Netsmartz Develops a ERP System for a US eCommerce Firm
Austin, Texas
Location
5
Team Size
eCommerce
Industry
Netsmartz’s engagement with an eCommerce firm was to develop a data transformation engine to increase its profitability through deep data analytics.
About
The Company
This eCommerce firm is based out of Austin, Texas. The client collaborated with several vendors to craft a portfolio of products to sell on Amazon.
The Tech Stack
.Net
MySQL
DevOps
Data Analytics
Team Composition
The engagement with Netsmartz was rolling resources based – on-need resources allocated per the project’s needs, requirements, and stage of progress. A project coordinator was the constant SPOC for this engagement.
The Problem
Statement
The client wanted to analyze how they were faring – against its competitors in the market. That meant they had to research and study their central seller data compared to similar industry sellers using the same eCommerce portal.
They looked at multiple data sources and needed help identifying the right data provider to further the data analysis.
Furthermore, they required DevOps support to host data analytics and transformation services.
The
Challenge
Essentially, the client was importing products and selling them on Amazon. But to assess the viability of those vendor partnerships, shipments, and products, the client wanted a data-backed solution.
One that could assess & report on the efficacy of purchases that the client made. That is, address the question of total profitability on every range and SKU of product that they ordered.
That meant analysis of the campaign, products, sales, offers, purchases, etc. The client wanted us to make a data engine replete with functionality.
The
Solution
Netsmartz’s flexible engagement model allowed the client to add and churn developers on demand. The rolling basis engagement was meant to reduce TCO, faster time-to-market, and add skills to the roster when needed.
The project coordinator helped assess and craft the architecture to enable a smoother data transformation process.
The team analyzed 2 data source providers and their constituent datasets and endpoint APIs to propose the final provider based on factors like the sanctity of data, refresh interval, performance, etc.
A MySQL central database was created in AWS, and an ETL library was developed to populate and refresh the MySQL data warehouse.
Further notifications were set up to alert about the non-availability of data.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Vetting Developers
The preliminary task was to identify skilled resources to work on the project. Since the project was based on a rolling resource engagement, the resources were allocated as and when needed, significantly reducing the investment required by the client.
Client Interviews
After the resource selection, the developer candidates were introduced to the client for further vetting and interviews. This process also included getting the developers acquainted with the client, their requirements, procedures, and methodologies.
Team Engagement
The project coordinator assessed the client’s requirements and understood their tech stack and engineering requirements.
Scaling Project
As per the rolling resources engagement, the team was scaled and churned on-demand as and when the progression required.
The
Result
The primary achievements of this project were:
Netsmartz enabled clients to leverage their data to power their revenue through better sales, marketing, and customer service support.
It further resulted in better profitability for the client since now, they could get a perspective on increasing their profits, sign on new products/vendors, and drive through ambiguity.
They were able to lower costs by eliminating non-performing products and further increase the production/purchase of more demanded products in the market.

Boosting Growth with Accurate Sales Data for Digital Manufacturing Software Company
San Francisco, USA
Location
03
Team Size
Digital Manufacturing
Industry
About
The Company
Our client is a Digital Manufacturing Ecosystem that delivers custom mechanical parts at unprecedented speeds through its digital platform and a vetted, controlled global partner network.
The Tech Stack
ZoomInfo
LinkedIn Sales Navigator
Apollo.io
Team Composition
1 Senior Project Manager, 2 Data Miners
The Problem
Statement
The client aimed to identify potential leads in target enterprise accounts. These leads were about a Million influencers and decision makers in the US market alone. Their target audience included engineers involved in product production in target companies.
The
Challenge
The client had a clear objective of increasing revenue. To achieve this goal, they needed someone to take off the load of manual data mining and market research and provide them with high-quality database for their target prospects.
However, the client faced a significant challenge regarding how to quickly and efficiently mine this data without significant investment in tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ZoomInfo etc.
Identifying each and every lead and gathering contact information can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the client just had a team which could focus on outreach activities.
The
Solution
Netsmartz implemented a comprehensive approach that was tailored to meet their unique needs. Throughout the project, we worked closely with the client to ensure that their needs were met and their expectations were exceeded everyday.
We started by defining the client’s target audience. This involved analyzing their current customer base, understanding their products and services, and identifying the demographics of their potential customers.
Based on the defined target audience, we selected relevant data points such as job titles, company size, industry, and location to filter out the most appropriate leads.
We leveraged a mix of commercial and open web data intelligence tools to identify high-quality vetted leads and contact information to create a comprehensive database of potential customers, including their contact information and other relevant data points. We collected the relevant data points for each lead and ensured the data was accurate and up-to-date.
We analyzed the data to determine patterns and trends within the target audience, allowing us to understand their needs and preferences better.
Based on the analysis of the gathered data, we refined the target audience to ensure that we were targeting the most relevant and promising leads.
We provided the client with the high-quality sales data we had gathered, enabling them to focus on their core business activities while still accessing the necessary information to drive revenue growth.
The
Result
The 2 dedicated Data Mining Resources provide stellar data on 160+ unique prospects every day, making it about 3200+ prospects every month. The client has zero obligation to invest the time of its busy Sales Representative towards this task and saves all the budget that would have otherwise gone into data intelligence tool subscriptions.
Client’s Sales Representatives and the Marketing team saved their countless precious hours and invested them into what matters most, i.e. qualitative prospecting campaigns.

Resource horsepower was provided to empower Rapid Solution Development for a SaaS Software Firm
2009-Ongoing
Duration
Alabama
Location
”
”
Software
Industry
Netsmartz allocated a dedicated team to bolster the client’s product development expertise and add to their team’s capabilities to build their software marketplace platform.
About
The Company
The Client’s organization is a Software and IT solutions company based out of Birmingham, Alabama. As an organization, they provide IT solutions to different firms and organizations. For this engagement, The Client needed to augment their development team with dozens of Netsmartz remote team members to build a custom software app – a software marketplace platform for the real estate industry – based on the client’s core service offerings.
The Tech Stack
MongoDB
Express
Angular
Node
Team Composition
The team deployed for the client consisted of dozens of developers allocated in different phases throughout the engagement, with the main SPOCs being the business analysts and project managers.
The Problem
Statement
The client wanted a dedicated set of developers to assist their In-house team to build a software solution. This requirement was an end to end solution development. They needed to stand up dozens of engineers and skills to support the development lifecycle and steer the custom software platform through different stages of product development – outlines, development, planning, and product deployment.
This meant allocation of an entire unit – comprising of DevOps, Full stack developers, Business analysts, a Project manager, and a SCRUM master which would not have been a viable action domestically within time frame or duration of this development.
The
Challenge
For this particular assignment, the client had clear requirements. And they had a precise set of tenets that they needed their software partner to espouse.
A Team that had technical expertise across multiple tech stacks including iOS, Web, Cloud solutions: The premise for this was to maintain a coherent sense of collaboration and make it easier for the client’s team to track and map the progress.
The client needed a team that could bring in proven SaaS and product development expertise. There was a directive for project managers to guide the autonomous team of developers.
The client took a passively development role, empowering Netsmartz to spin up an adequate infrastructure to power their product, and to assemble and manage the remote team.
The
Solution
For this specific custom software project, Netsmartz worked with the client’s internal team to develop software solutions, conduct life cycle testing, and production deployment. While the client’s in-house team authored the core set of requirements to create outlines for their products, the Netsmartz team was trusted to decide on the tech stack and other tools utilized for the product design and development stages.
Apart from designing mockups for their team to review, Netsmartz worked towards establishing an architecture implemented across the platform. Upon securing the client’s approval, Netsmartz’s team proceeded with the development phase, implementing the client’s preferred functionalities and design elements.
Our
Process
The client’s engagement was methodical and phased in different steps
Mapping & Vetting Developers
The client clarified its scope of development and the requirements that they had from a dedicated team. After they expressed the of a full-fledged team for their operations, a proper vetting and interviewing process was jumpstarted.
Collaboration
Client’s and Netsmartz’s team worked in organized and progressive workflow managing tasks in collaborative development sprints with our project managers and business analyst’s working with their team to define project outlines and our developers bringing that outline to fruition in design and development stages
Communication
The collaborative effort also involved regular product demos and progress updates so that the client’s team was abreast of the changes, implementations, plans, and milestones for the product’s deployment.
The
Result
The engagement helped client craft a high-yielding software solution that unfailingly elevated their business. Additionally, the engagement with Netsmartz’s team helped them establish satisfactory control over their development cycle and production deadlines.
The engagement also enabled the client to consistently improve its app over a long timeframe horizon with consistent additions of new features and functionality to keep it relevant in their target market space.

Migrating VM to Kubernetes for
End-to-End Automation
USA
Location
9
Team Size
Product Based
Industry
Netsmartz’s expertise facilitated the seamless transition of a product-based company from virtual machines to Kubernetes, leveraging Terraform, GitHub Actions, and Amazon EKS for end-to-end automation.
About
The Company
The client, a product-based company, recognized the need to modernize their infrastructure and embrace Kubernetes for enhanced scalability and automation. Seeking a reliable DevOps partner, they approached us to guide their transition from virtual machines (VMs) to Kubernetes while ensuring end-to-end automation.
The Tech Stack
DevOps
React
Node.JS
Team Composition
7 Developers, 2 DevOps Engineers
The Problem
Statement
The client’s reliance on traditional virtual machines hindered their ability to scale efficiently, resulting in resource limitations and potential performance bottlenecks. The client faced the challenge of bridging the expertise gap and ensuring a successful migration without disrupting their operations. Automating the end-to-end deployment pipeline, including infrastructure provisioning, testing, deployment, and monitoring, presented a significant challenge.
The
Challenge
While undertaking this endeavor, we recognized multiple challenges like:
Ensuring that all elements of the cluster were reproducible and aligned with best practices required a strategic approach, especially given the complexity of Kubernetes configurations.
Migrating applications from traditional VMs to containerized environments involves potential compatibility issues, data transfer challenges, and the need for rigorous testing.
Ensuring that applications functioned correctly within Kubernetes and addressing any migration-related issues was a key challenge.
The
Solution
Netsmartz orchestrated a comprehensive solution encompassing VM to Kubernetes migration, end-to-end automation using Terraform and GitHub Actions, and harnessing the power of Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
We initiated the engagement by thoroughly assessing the client’s existing infrastructure and business requirements. We devised a migration plan and automation strategy tailored to their needs based on the analysis.
Leveraging Terraform, we designed infrastructure as code templates to define the Kubernetes cluster infrastructure on AWS EKS. This approach ensured consistent and reproducible infrastructure provisioning.
We set up GitHub Actions workflows to automate the CI/CD pipeline. From code commits to deployment, testing, and monitoring, the workflows streamlined the development process and enforced best practices.
Our team migrated the client’s applications to Amazon EKS, leveraging Kubernetes’ orchestration, scaling, and resource management capabilities. EKS provided the foundation for their containerized environment.
Rigorous testing and validation were conducted to ensure the successful migration of applications, seamless scaling, and adherence to operational requirements.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Identifying Appropriate Resources
At Netsmartz, we conducted a detailed analysis of the project’s scope and requirements to determine the appropriate resources to be assigned to the project.
Team Engagement
The team was provided training for a week before they started working with the client. This involved understanding the client’s niche and requirements. The learning curve enabled them to generate 95% accuracy.
Consistent Client Feedback & Action
At Netsmartz, we prioritize listening to our client’s feedback and concerns. We responded promptly to client feedback, acknowledging receipt and providing action updates. This allowed us to maintain a strong client relationship and ensured that we addressed any concerns or issues they may have promptly and effectively.
The
Result
Netsmartz successfully migrated the client’s VMs to Kubernetes, ensuring uninterrupted operations and harnessing Kubernetes’ scalability. Employing Terraform and GitHub Actions, we automated processes from provisioning to monitoring. Dynamic scaling in Kubernetes optimized resource use, while Terraform enhanced reproducibility. Prometheus and Grafana provided real-time insights, expediting issue resolution. The automated CI/CD pipeline accelerated development, culminating in a seamless transition to Kubernetes, elevated operational efficiency, and a robust foundation for ongoing innovation in product development.

Server Management and Performance Optimization for Retail Electronics Giant
Middle East
Location
24
Team Size
E-commerce
Industry
Transforming electronic major’s online business by efficiently managing servers and optimizing website performance, enhancing user experience and business growth.
About
The Company
The client is a well-established electronics retail brand renowned for its diverse product range and exceptional customer service. With a commitment to providing an enjoyable shopping journey, they sought to enhance website performance and streamline server management for optimal user experience.
The Tech Stack
DevOps
Magento
Team Composition
40 Developers, 4 DevOps Engineers
The Problem
Statement
The client’s existing infrastructure suffered from frequent server instability, leading to slow page load times and occasional downtimes during peak traffic. Poor website performance due to slow-loading pages impacted user experience negatively, potentially leading to lower engagement and conversions. Downtimes and slow performance during peak traffic periods resulted in revenue loss due to missed sales opportunities.
The
Challenge
While undertaking this endeavor, we recognized multiple challenges like:
Unidentified bottlenecks in the infrastructure causing performance issues needed to be identified and resolved.
The website’s infrastructure needed to handle sudden traffic spikes seamlessly without compromising user experience or causing downtime.
Users across different geographic locations experienced varying latency levels, affecting page load times.
The
Solution
Netsmartz meticulously crafted a solution that focused on mitigating server-related issues and optimizing the website’s performance, elevating E-commerce’s digital presence and revenue potential.
Our experts began by comprehensively assessing the client’s infrastructure and identifying pain points and bottlenecks. This audit laid the foundation for a targeted approach to address specific issues.
To tackle server instability, we optimized server configurations, fine-tuning resource allocation for efficient performance. We implemented auto-scaling mechanisms to handle traffic surges seamlessly, ensuring an uninterrupted user experience during peak periods.
Leveraging a global CDN, we strategically distributed website content to edge servers, reducing latency and accelerating user page load times across different geographic locations.
Our team employed caching strategies such as object caching and page caching to reduce the load on backend servers, improving response times and overall website performance.
We optimized database queries, indexes, and schemas to enhance database performance. This led to quicker data retrieval, improving website responsiveness.
We implemented a monitoring system using tools like New Relic and Nagios to maintain optimal performance. Real-time alerts enabled us to identify and address any emerging issues swiftly.
As part of server management, we reinforced security measures, implementing firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits to safeguard customer data and maintain compliance.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Identifying Appropriate Resources
At Netsmartz, we conducted a detailed analysis of the project’s scope and requirements to determine the appropriate resources to be assigned to the project.
Team Engagement:
The team was provided training for a week before they started working with the client. This involved understanding the client’s niche and requirements. The learning curve enabled them to generate 95% accuracy.
Consistent Client Feedback & Action
At Netsmartz, we prioritize listening to our client’s feedback and concerns. We responded promptly to client feedback, acknowledging receipt and providing action updates. This allowed us to maintain a strong client relationship and ensured that we addressed any concerns or issues they may have promptly and effectively.
The
Result
Netsmartz’s efforts to enhance website performance through reduced page load times improved user satisfaction and engagement, driving higher conversions and sales. The optimized server configurations ensured consistent availability, even during traffic spikes, minimizing downtime and preserving revenue. This scalable infrastructure foundation supported seamless business growth. Strengthened security measures further protected customer data, increasing retention and attracting new customers. Overall, these achievements underscored significant business growth.

The Problem
Statement
The client was struggling with managing their IT infrastructure and ensuring secure access to sensitive information, all while meeting the complex requirements of HIPAA regulations. They needed to provide the highest level of security, compliance, and reliability to protect patient data and accelerate the delivery of new features and updates to remain competitive in the market. These challenges posed a significant problem for the organization, as they risked non-compliance with HIPAA regulations, which could result in severe penalties and reputational damage.
The
Challenge
The challenge was to seamlessly improve the client’s infrastructure while minimizing disruptions to their business operations.
Reducing the risk of data breaches associated with sensitive patient data was a significant challenge for Netsmartz.
Patient data is highly valuable on the black market, making it a prime target for cybercriminals. Therefore, it was crucial to implement robust security measures, such as data encryption, access controls, and threat monitoring, to protect patient data.
Additionally, regular audits and assessments were necessary to identify and fix vulnerabilities quickly before they could be exploited.
The
Solution
Netsmartz implemented a comprehensive solution that was tailored to meet their unique needs. Throughout the project, we worked closely with the client to ensure that their needs were met and their expectations were exceeded.
First, we defined project constraints and clear goals for scalability, reliability, and security, which helped us to ensure that we delivered a solution that met the client’s requirements within the set parameters.
We then conducted regular audits and assessments to ensure that the website remained compliant with HIPAA regulations and met the highest security and reliability standards. Our team implemented secure coding practices to ensure the website was free from known security weaknesses.
To enhance reliability, we configured automated builds and deployment pipelines using Azure DevOps that integrate with Azure Security and compliance tools, such as Azure Security Center, Azure Policy, etc. Additionally, we used Prometheus, Grafana, Promtail, and Loki for monitoring and logging to identify and fix issues quickly while ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations. We also kept track of access to PHI (Protected Health Information) data and performed regular audits to ensure data security and privacy.
Our
Process
To build a cohesive engagement replete with updates, QA, and feedback loops, Netsmartz followed the following process.
Talent Identification
We started with assessing the client’s requirements and understanding their tech stack and engineering requirements. After a thorough assessment and multiple feedback & interviews, we sorted the candidates for the client’s dedicated team.
Team Allocation
All team members were of Netsmartz
Team Engagement
Throughout the project, the team maintained a close collaboration with the client to ensure that all of their requirements were met. We followed an agile methodology, holding regular sprint reviews, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives to track progress and quickly address any issues that arose. By following this approach, we were able to ensure that the project progressed smoothly and aligned with the client’s needs.
The
Result
Netsmartz successfully addressed the challenges faced by the client by implementing a comprehensive solution tailored to their unique needs. The solution helped the organization improve its IT infrastructure, enhance security and reliability, and maintain compliance with HIPAA regulations.
Overall, the solution provided by Netsmartz enabled the healthcare organization to reduce the risk of data breaches associated with sensitive patient data while accelerating the time to market for new features and updates, which helped them to achieve their business objectives.

Rehash & Building Scalable Software Solutions for an eCommerce Agency
Austin, Texas, USA
Location

Team Size
Marketing & eCommerce
Industry
The engagement with Canopy Management was for 18 months. The client partnered with us for the development & maintenance of a primary software system used by their customers for managing their Amazon seller accounts. The engagement was led by a Solutions Architect and a Project Manager, along with a roster of 4 developers, 1 QC, and a DevOps engineer.
About
The Company
The client is a major player in the Amazon seller ecosystem – providing a range of consultative services from PPC to creative services, and a demand-side platform solution as well.
As an industry-leading full service marketing agency for Amazon sellers, Canopy had intensive data management requirements, server operations, and a Solutions framework to parse and operate their seller data.
The Tech Stack
Symphony with PHP
RabbitMQ
Vue.js
Elastic Search
MariaDB
Azure
Team Composition
The team consisted of
1 solutions architect
,
1 project manager
,
1 QC
,
1 DevOps
, and
4 developers
that were deployed in phases on the project.
The Problem
Statement
The client was running recurring Cron jobs for pulling central seller data using Amazon APIs, and due to the heavy data load, the server was unresponsive. Since the older development team was discontinued, the client’s server was in disarray, managing their server, resulting in complaining from customers, reduced business revenue, and a absolute lack of system design.
Thus they needed a solutions framework along with required resources in urgency.
Further, they had a list of backlog items that were required to be developed, and they needed a full-fledged development team to set up and jumpstart their project to explore its full potential.
The
Challenge
The client’s primary challenge was making their software system work again. On that note, the immediate trouble did not have adequate engineering or development resources. For instance, the client did not have a server administrator – which made server operations particularly challenging.
Furthermore, the client wanted us to take care of their backlogs – modules and features that needed rapid development – to get on par with market relevance and customer requirements.
Additionally, the client needed us to introduce product targeting for SBA and SBV – i.e., sponsored brand ads and sponsored brands video – through an intuitive dashboard that developed reports and made the process of Amazon targeting & data fetching seamless.
The
Solution
Netsmartz kickstarted the engagement with Canopy Management by deploying a Solutions Architect and a DevOps Engineer. The purpose was to manage the disarray of the server and lay the foundation for future development tasks.
Netsmartz suggested moving their current server infrastructure to Azure for scalability & performance enhancement. Further, a structure for the development team was proposed to handle the feature development (modules above & backlogs).
Netsmartz did a lift-and-shift of their current infrastructure and proposed containerization for better utilization of server resources.
The server end was taken care of, the Netsmartz development team was introduced, and they started the feature development and the overall application containerization.
The new feature development was started while considering the need for optimized processes.
Our
Process
The project was – for all purposes – started from scratch. Jumpstarting the project meant cleaning the server chaos, introducing DevOps resources, and then building the software.
Resource allocation
After a thorough understanding of the client’s requirements, Netsmartz selected and deployed resources for the DevOps and Development work for the client. This process was prologued by the candidate’s selection, vetting, and interview.
Management of resources
An experienced project manager was allocated to manage the processes for the client – including the infra shift and the allocation and planning of feature/module development. The project manager was tasked with managing the resources, the requirements, and the day-to-day operations vis-a-vis the deadlines. Additionally, the project manager worked to hold regular SCRUM meetings and manage the deliverables.
Solutions Architect deployment & DevOps engineering work
A solutions architect was introduced to establish an understanding of the server infrastructure, after which the DevOps engineer brought in processes and expertise to move the server to Azure.
The
Result
Even with the absence of domain knowledgable and the right resources from the client – and near makeshift solution architecture – Netsmartz handled their server management & development of several features to protect over 80% of the client’s paying customer base.
The further achievement of Netsmartz’s team was to introduce the unversed team at Canopy – thus helping them set up standardized software development processes per the industry benchmark.
Getting the MVP out quickly was the primary motivation and consideration for the project’s success.

How Netsmartz helped a Sports Analytics Firm build High-Caliber Software & ensure Quality
Custom Software Development
Project
Champaign, Illinois
Location
Sports
Industry
Netsmartz was brought in to supplement the organization’s development team. On that note, our engineers worked with different specialists to resolve issues and fix bugs in the software and helped the sports firm’s team craft high-caliber software.
About
The Company
The Organization is a sports analytics firm based out of Illinois that focuses on data collection and sports-based analytics for distance running teams and general fitness customers.
The platform that our resource worked on was a mobile system that used a universal timer to allow people –particularly coaches, distance running teams, cross-country teams, and track-and-field teams – to collect data at training and sports meets.
The Tech Stack
MongoDB
Express
React
Node
Appium
Selenium
iOS
Android
Team Composition
The team consisted of QA resources, Full stack developers, and a Senior Engineer to map the app’s progress while acting as a SPOC for the in-house team at the sports firm.
The Problem
Statement
Since the industry and the sports/fitness market were fast-moving, the client was keen on learning about iterative development.
This was supposedly possible only with a strong development partner with proven expertise and experience delivering intuitive applications.
Additionally, the client needed clarification about reliability of a software partner and the dedicated team. The client also expressed their hesitation – since they had to invent and reinvent a solution – thus their apprehension in working with a sweatshop/freelancer.
The
Challenge
The Sports firm had a primary application already in the development phase. However, the firm needed assistance in managing the technical issues, bugs, and dev sprints while working with other development teams.
The goal was to work collaboratively across teams to craft a high-performance application – tackling eventual obsolescence and grow iteratively as per the market/customer feedback loops.
On that note, the sports firm brought in Netsmartz to provide senior engineering resources to help hash out bugs and fix any technical troubles in the app.
The
Solution
Netsmartz was chosen after a deliberate research process – wherein the sports firm looked through different agencies that could supplement their team. Since they were a startup, the budget was a critical in selecting the right strategic partner. Netsmartz, was chosen as the righ fit for the firm through its proven delivery strategy and its on-demand, affordable services.
As for the solution, Netsmartz provided senior-level engineering services and supplemented a lot of the bug-fixing and adjustment efforts for the application. Along with the client’s team, we also worked towards stabilizing the platform by taking out and reengineering different erroneous sections, working closely with the QA specialists and principal engineers.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed its proven routine of vetting, allocation, and collaboration for this engagement.
Mapping & Vetting Developers
After the scope of development and testing was finalized, Netsmartz allocate a senior engineer to act as a SPOC, helm the engagement, and allocated developers flexibly to take care of the client’s development requirements. Additionally, the Senior Engineer also placed QA resources to manage bugs and ascertain the viability of the client’s primary app.
Collaboration
Netsmartz’s team worked in an Agile manner – considering the iterative nature of development, as well as consistent feedback loops set in place. The work happened in collaborative development sprints with our Senior engineer. Netsmartz’s Senior Resource also worked towards creating a seamless collaboration schematic while reducing the errors and issues on the platform.
Scaling & Reporting
The work and its impact were measured by the velocity of tickets sorted and completed. In that regard, our Senior Resource delivered objective results and helped the organization and its team fix all of the bugs on their platform while ensuring seamless development.
The
Result
Netsmartz’s Senior Engineer worked in a very agile manner to facilitate smoother development – so that the firm could constantly reprioritize and not base its success on whether or not the deadline was met.
Apart from the resource allocation, Netsmartz’s executive streamlined the communication needed to work through business challenges and other issues while also actively finding additional talent for the client.
The result was an app that was comprehensive in its utility and seamless functionality. The engagement resulted in a quicker time to market for the client, ensuring better customer onboarding & a definitive RoI.

Frequently Asked Questions
Do you have additional questions?
What is the difference between a full stack developer and a MEAN stack developer?
Full-stack developers must be familiar with a variety of technologies to work on both server-side and client-side software development. MEAN stack development is a collection of four full-stack technologies that may be used to create a full-stack application.
Full-stack refers to a set of programming languages and the tools that a developer learns for both the front-end and backend of a website. Express.js, MongoDB, NodeJS, & AngularJS make up the MEAN stack, a popular full-stack framework.
What is the purpose of the MEAN stack?
MEAN (MongoDB, Express. js, Angular or Angular JS, Node JS) is a JavaScript software stack for creating dynamic websites and web applications that is free and open-source.
What skills does our MEAN stack developer include?
Our MEAN stack developer must possess the following abilities:
The programming languages HTML, CSS, and javascript are used.
Musk knows Frameworks based on CSS and JS.
Understanding the architecture and workflow is required.
Understanding of client-side and server-side processes and requirements is required.
What is the cost of hiring a MEAN stack developer?
Actually, there’s no direct answer to this. The cost of hiring a MEAN stack developer is determined by a variety of factors, including the development platform, the application type, the design complexity, the number of pages, features, and functionalities, and the cost of maintenance.
You can hire our remote MEAN stack developer either on an hourly or fixed fee basis. To know more about our engagement model, read here;
https://netsmartz.com/engagement-models/

Frequently Asked Questions
Do you have additional questions?
Can I build my website mobile-friendly using ReactJs?
Yes, React is considered a popular tool, widely used by many businesses to build websites and applications. All you need is to hire a team of ReactJS developers from Netsmartz having years of experience. They are well-versed with JavaScript, HTML, and other methods to create a responsive design accessible on multiple devices (Android, iOS, or Windows).
Will migrating/building an application in ReactJS help me save money & time?
Well, React is a robust framework with UI frameworks and tools. Our team of full-stack ReactJS developers will help you build a user interface with a single codebase that makes it easy to plan and develop the app. This ultimately leads to a lower development cost for your application. Doing so will even help you save your time and money.
Why is ReactJS developer a perfect choice for my Business?
Businesses using ReactJS are expecting greater results as compared to those using other frameworks. Why? Because ReactJS is robust, Dynamic, and Interactive. The core objective of hiring a ReactJS developer is to provide the best possible rendering performance. Instead of working on the entire web app, our ReactJS developer breaks down the complex UI into simpler components.
I have an idea or MVP for the ReactJS project, Now what?
Our skilled ReactJS developers have the capability of turning your idea or MVP into the next big project. Our dedicated ReactJS developers collaborate with you to better understand your vision and then build a full-fledged product from scratch.
What is the difference between ReactJS & React Native?
ReactJS is a front-end JavaScript library that creates a web program that is dynamic, robust, and interactive. Whereas, React Native is a cross-platform app development framework for creating mobile apps. ReactJS is best for generating apps with a lot of functionality and calculations. React Native is best for giving your mobile apps a native feel.

Frequently Asked Questions
Do you have additional questions?
What is the difference between manual and automated testing?
Manual testing involves executing test cases manually (by a human) without tools or scripts. Whereas, Automated test cases are run using tools, scripts, and software.
How many rounds of testing are enough for my project?
There can’t be a specific condition to decide “When to end the testing process?”. Testing is a continuous process, but after a few rounds, you will have enough trust in the status of your software product because it has been thoroughly tested against all functional criteria.
What are the responsibilities of test developers?
Test developers write the codes for the programs and implement them, which automatically checks the flaws. They should be familiar with programming languages including PERL, HTML, and JavaScript. They frequently use quality testing software such as ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) in their work.
What is the difference between alpha and beta testing?
Alpha testing is a type of software testing that is used to find issues before a product is launched in the market to real users or the general public. Genuine users of the software application undertake beta testing ( One sort of User Acceptance Testing) in a real environment.
Why is testing so vital in mobile app development?
Your ultimate goal is for more users to use your app, which is highly unlikely if it fails. That is why it is critical to test mobile apps. To stand out in a crowded/competitive market of mobile apps, you’ll have to create a user-friendly, high-quality, scalable, and unique mobile app.

The US-based client offers highly efficient and reliable marketing resource management software. They sought assistance from Netsmartz experts to localize their products successfully.
About
The Company
The client offers highly efficient and reliable marketing resource management software to businesses globally, enabling them to maximize their earnings and savings. The client’s MRM software, built on Salesforce Lightning, stands out as the most advanced and comprehensive solution. It incorporates automated Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) to accurately predict and optimize marketing strategies’ return on investment (ROI).

The Problem
Statement
The client faced the critical challenge of providing a personalized experience to their diverse global audience on their platform. Recognizing the importance of catering to the unique requirements of businesses in different regions, the team sought assistance from Netsmartz experts to localize their products successfully. The problem was ensuring that the platform effectively fulfills the specific needs and expectations of businesses in every geographical region, enhancing user engagement and overall customer satisfaction.
The
Challenge
Implementing the Marketing Cloud solution for the client was challenging because regional marketing capabilities were required. Adapting the marketing tool to cater to the unique requirements of each region proved to be the most difficult aspect of the project. The team had to find flexible solutions to accommodate the diverse needs of end clients and ensure that the platform supported their specific marketing strategies. Custom product enhancements were required to fully update predictive and prescriptive analytics for each region, adding complexity to the implementation process. Overcoming these challenges was crucial to providing clients with an effective and tailored marketing solution.
The
Solution
Netsmartz implemented a comprehensive approach that was tailored to meet their unique needs. Throughout the project, we worked closely with the client to ensure that their needs were met and their expectations were exceeded.
To offer businesses a comprehensive view of the customer journey, the team successfully implemented Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Leveraging our expertise, we efficiently completed the entire implementation process within a week, enabling businesses to manage customer journeys and interactions easily.
Following the SFMC implementation, our team extensively customized the existing platform, leveraging the client’s packages. The primary objective was to deliver tailored features to clients, ensuring they received suitable solutions at competitive prices. This approach facilitated seamless client onboarding and improved sales outcomes.
Addressing the most challenging aspect of the client’s project, we focused on providing flexible solutions within the marketing tool to meet the unique requirements of end clients in their respective regions. We successfully updated predictive and prescriptive analytics through custom product enhancements, empowering businesses to optimize their marketing strategies based on specific regional considerations effectively.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & identifying appropriate resources
At Netsmartz, we conducted a detailed analysis of the project’s scope and requirements to determine the appropriate resources to be assigned to the project.
Team Engagement
The team was provided training for a week before they started working with the client. This involved understanding the client’s niche and requirements.  The learning curve enabled them to generate 95% accuracy.
Consistent Client Feedback & Action
At Netsmartz, we prioritize listening to our client’s feedback and concerns. We responded promptly to client feedback, acknowledging receipt and providing action updates. This allowed us to maintain a strong client relationship and ensured that we addressed any concerns or issues they may have promptly and effectively.
The
Result
Netsmartz played a pivotal role in enhancing the intelligence and customization of this platform through Salesforce Marketing Cloud, yielding remarkable outcomes. These include a streamlined customer onboarding process, amplified platform usage, and, ultimately, delighted and contented end users.

Privacy Policy
We, Netsmartz, LLC (“Netsmartz”), are committed to protecting any data that we collect concerning you. By using our services, you agree to the use of the data that we collect in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to enable you to understand what personal information is collected, how and when we might use or share your information and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. This Privacy Policy also explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
Who We Are
Netsmartz provides application solutions, including web hosting, domain name registration and related products and services to businesses, individuals, non-profit organizations and others.
Information Collected
We collect the following types of information to provide you with the products and services you purchased and for the purposes described below. We may collect any or all of the information via automated means such as communications profiles or cookies.
“SMS opt-in and phone numbers collected for SMS communication purposes will not be shared with any third party and affiliates for marketing purposes.”
Personal Information:
The personal information we collect depends on the type of service, support, or sales inquiry that is occurring and may include your name, address, telephone number, fax number, email address, dates of service provided, types of service provided, payment history, manner of payment, amount of payments, date of payments, domain name, credit card or other payment information. The financial information will only be used to bill you for the products and services you purchased. If you purchase by credit card, this information may be forwarded to your credit card provider. When transferring personal information, a security icon will appear in your browser.
Cookies and Tracking:
Your Internet browser has the in-built facility for storing small text files – “cookies” – that hold information which allows a website to recognize your account. We use cookies to save your preferences and login information and to provide personalized functionality. We may use cookies to collect, store and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. More specifically, we use different types of cookies for different purposes:
“Required cookies” are necessary for our website to work properly.
“Performance cookies” allow us to analyze how visitors use our website so that we can measure and improve the performance of our website.
“Functional cookies” allow us to remember choices you may have made on our website.
“Advertising cookies” are used to present ads that are relevant to your interests.
We may utilize cookies to track referrals from internal and external affiliates, as well as advertising campaigns. We may also use a third party service provider to send emails that you have agreed to receive. Pixel tags and cookies may be used in those email messages to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and to enable us to provide more focused marketing communications to you. You can reject cookies by changing your browser settings, but be aware that this will disable some of the functionality on the Netsmartz.com website.
Customer Surveys:
We may periodically conduct customer surveys. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. However, we encourage our users to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information, if provided, will remain confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party service provider on our behalf.
Social Media:
Our website includes social media features (such as the Facebook “Like” button). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our website and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets may be hosted by a third party or directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature.
Data and Information Submitted to Third Parties on Our Network:
This Privacy Policy does not apply to data or personal information that may be submitted to, or collected by, third-party websites hosted by Netsmartz or to domain names registered by Netsmartz. Such websites and domain names are not owned or controlled by Netsmartz. You should independently evaluate the privacy policies of such third-party websites before submitting data or personal information to them.
Information Use
Personal Information:
The information we collect is used for billing and to provide service and support to our customers. We may study this information to determine our customers’ needs and to promote certain products and services or additional support. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from information that our customers provide during registration (such as the total number of customers in a given category). This aggregated and non-identifying information may be used to promote advertisements that appear on our website and in connection with our services. We take reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized access to your information. Accordingly, we may require you to provide additional forms of identity should you wish to obtain information about your account details. Netsmartz may also use the information you provide to email Netsmartz’s monthly newsletter to the primary contact e-mail on file, or to contact you about other products or services that we think may be of interest.
Log Files:
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our site and servers, track access and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. However, it is possible that personal information about a customer may be included in the log files due to the normal functions of IP addresses and Web browsing.
Customer Surveys:
We may use the contact and other information provided to follow up with customers who respond to our customer surveys to help resolve issues internally or with our third party partners. For example, Netsmartz may contact customers based on their survey answers or to highlight certain changes we made in response to customer feedback.
Disclosing Information
Partners and Sponsors:
Some of our products or services are offered or promoted to our customers in conjunction with a partner or sponsor, or another brand or company within our corporate family. We may share your information with these parties to offer the product or service or to facilitate your use of additional amenities included with your hosting account. For example, one of our partners may provide services to you based on links that you access from your control panel. We may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from users to potential partners, reputable third parties and other companies or brands within our corporate family. We will only share your information with third parties that agree to maintain your information in confidence and to use it solely for purposes of providing the product or service as agreed to by Netsmartz.
Service Providers:
We may transfer (or otherwise make available) your personal information to third parties that help us provide our services or provide services on our behalf. For example, we may use service providers to authorize and process payments, administer surveys, or run promotions. Your personal information may be maintained and processed by our third party service providers in the United States or in other jurisdictions. Our service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes.
Online Advertisements:
We do not share personally identifiable information about individual customers with advertisers.
Customer Surveys:
We may share customer information obtained from customer surveys within Netsmartz and our corporate family and with trusted third parties to develop or provide products and services that we believe would be of interest to our customers.
Domain Registration:
In certain jurisdictions or pursuant to the rules of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) or certain registries, the contact information you provide to register a domain name (“Domain Name Registration Information”) has to be made available and accessible to the public through a “WHOIS” search. The WHOIS database is a publicly accessible database that lists the Domain Name Registration Information for a particular domain name, the name server(s) to which the domain name points and the domain name’s creation and expiration date. The Domain Name Registration Information you provide is hosted by us or a third party service provider and is made available to the public through WHOIS searches. At times, customers may receive solicitations that result from searches of the publicly available WHOIS database by other companies or individuals. Any such solicitations or SPAM do not come from Netsmartz and we do not control the use of WHOIS information by third parties. Further, pursuant to ICANN rules, Netsmartz is required to make WHOIS data available to any third party that enters into a bulk access agreement. While ICANN allows individuals to opt-out (using the account management panel, domain management console or similar service) of having their WHOIS information made available to third parties through bulk access, companies, such as ours, businesses and other organizations do not have the ability to opt-out of having their information made available to a third party that enters a bulk access agreement. We may also deposit your Domain Name Registration Information with a third-party escrow provider to comply with ICANN requirements.
Law Enforcement and Special Cases:
We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about users upon a valid request by government or law officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas), to protect your property and rights, or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to stop activity that we consider illegal or unethical.
Your Options
Correcting/Updating Personal Information:
If a customer’s information changes, or if a customer no longer desires our services, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that customer’s personal data in our records. In most cases, this can be achieved by emailing us at
privacy@netsmartz.com
.
Opt Out:
By default, customers will receive invoices, any system updates, Netsmartz newsletters and other mailings. Customers are able to opt out of newsletters and mailings by using the unsubscribe link in any promotional email or as otherwise provided in the communication. Please note that customers may not opt out of receiving important system notifications or emails about their accounts.
Public Forums:
Please remember that any information you may disclose or post on public areas of our websites or the Internet, becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these public areas. To request removal of your personal information from our community forums or testimonials, contact us at
privacy@netsmartz.com
. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know why we are unable to do so.
Data Security
Netsmartz uses technical security measures to prevent the loss, misuse, alternation or unauthorized disclosure of information under our control. Netsmartz uses security measures including and not limited to: physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. All sensitive information is collected on a secure server. When we ask customers or users to provide financial information (such as a credit card number) that data is protected using Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) technology.

Information Related to Data Collected through Resellers:
Customers who seek access or who seek to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to the Reseller’s data controller. If the Reseller requests that we remove the data, we will respond to such request within thirty (30) business days.

How Netsmartz designed & development e-commerce websites & Social tracking app for Marine Supplies Business
North America
Location
5
Team Size
Marine & Boat Building E-comm
Industry
The company provides tools and marine supplies for woodworkers, craftsmen, Boat builders, and DIY makers that help them with their projects – Boats, woodworking, home restoration, art, etc.
About
The Company
The company is an industry leader in marine and boat-building supplies and has been supplying and assisting boaters for over 30 years. They help people with all kinds of boat-building products. The company is currently operating multiple websites to cater to different needs; for example:
One e-commerce website offers a wide range of marine paints, varnishes, epoxy resins, fiberglass supplies, adhesives, and other marine accessories.
They also serve as an online marketplace offering marine hardware, paints, coatings, tools, boatbuilding materials, and woodworking supplies.
They also have a dedicated support website that serves as a knowledge base and resource hub for customers seeking assistance, troubleshooting, and product-related information. It offers a wide range of helpful articles, guides, FAQs, and tutorials to address common inquiries and provide solutions for common issues.
The Tech Stack
Python
Machine Learning
AI
Shopify
Angular Js
Java
AWS
Team Composition
The team consists of a Project Manager, a Python developer, a Front-end developer, a Shopify developer, and Quality Analysts.
The Problem
Statement
The client had a requirement for a highly skilled team capable of handling the design and development of multiple e-commerce websites and a customer support website.
Furthermore, the client also sought expertise in creating a social tracking application specifically designed to monitor the performance of social advertisements.
One of the primary concerns for the client was ensuring high-quality deliverables across all these projects. They wanted to guarantee a seamless and error-free experience for their customers when placing orders online, which included accurate tax calculations and shipping charges.
The
Challenge
Multiple websites:
The need to design and develop a customer support website and two different e-commerce websites. Also, the websites need to be responsive and optimized for different devices and screen sizes to ensure a seamless user experience across desktops, mobile devices, and tablets.
Performance:
The overall page speed of e-commerce websites was quite slow, especially on the product pages.
Integration of Social Tracking Application:
Developing a social tracking application that effectively monitors the performance of social ads across various platforms was a challenge.
Implementation of Generative AI using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4:
AI models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 require vast amounts of high-quality training data to achieve optimal performance. Acquiring and curating such datasets were challenging, especially when dealing with specific marine domains.
The
Solution
Our team provided the following solutions to the problems:
E-commerce Websites:
Our team focused on creating user-friendly interfaces, incorporating robust features such as secure payment gateways, inventory management, order processing, and shipping integration.
Performance:
Netsmartz team conducted a complete performance analysis of the e-commerce websites, with a specific focus on the product pages. We identified the underlying factors contributing to the slow page speed. We also Minified the CSS and JavaScript files, reducing unnecessary HTTP requests.
Integration of Social Tracking Application:
Our team developed a custom social tracking application that integrates with social media platforms’ APIs to collect and analyze data related to social ads. We designed a user-friendly interface to present meaningful insights and performance metrics to the client.
Implementation of Generative AI using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4:
We used prompt engineering techniques, carefully crafting prompts and inputs to guide the AI models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) toward generating accurate and relevant responses.
Below is an overview of Generative AI implementation process:
a. Data Collection:
We collected a significant amount of data from different sources such as Jamestown’s support tickets, safety data sheets, and technical data sheets. These documents were in PDF format and contained valuable information about products and support inquiries.
b. Pinecone Vector Database:
The collected data was fed into the Pinecone vector database. Pinecone is a powerful vector database that allows for efficient indexing and searching of vectorized data. This indexing enables quick retrieval of relevant information based on user queries.
c. Slack Wrapper:
We developed a wrapper around Slack, an instant messaging and collaboration platform. This integration allowed users to interact with the system by asking questions related to support tickets or product knowledge directly within the Slack environment. This streamlined user experience facilitated easy and convenient access to information.
d. GPT-3.5 for Content Summarization:
We utilized GPT-3.5, a state-of-the-art language model, for content summarization. Given the extensive information contained in support tickets, safety data sheets, and technical data sheets, GPT-3.5 was used to generate concise and relevant summaries of the content. This summarization process helped provide users with condensed and meaningful answers to their queries.
e. GPT-4 for Response Generation:
We incorporated GPT-4, a more advanced version of the language model, for response generation. By inputting the user’s query and prompt into GPT-4, the system was able to generate more sophisticated and contextually appropriate responses. GPT-4’s improved capabilities were expected to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated responses compared to GPT-3.5.
Our
Process
Netsmartz helped the client by segmenting the design and development into different steps:
Requirements Gathering
1.Thoroughly understanding the client’s needs and gathering detailed requirements to establish clear project goals.
Development
Implementing the software solution based on the established requirements and design.
Testing and Quality Assurance
Rigorous testing was conducted to detect and address any bugs or issues, ensuring that the software operates smoothly and aligns with the client’s expectations.
Deployment and Integration
The software application was deployed to the AWS platform, enabling seamless integration and efficient operation.
The
Result
Netsmartz’s association with the client resulted in the following;
Netsmartz successfully Designed and Developed the e-commerce websites along with a dedicated s   upport website. These websites provided the client with a streamlined process for managing tickets and orders, improving their overall operational efficiency.
The social tracking application developed by Netsmartz gave the client a comprehensive analytical view of their ongoing social ads. This empowered the client to make data-driven decisions and plan a more effective marketing strategy, resulting in improved campaign performance and ROI.
The implementation of Generative AI provided the client with advanced natural language processing capabilities and improved customer support.
By overcoming the challenges and delivering effective solutions, Netsmartz helped improve the overall efficiency of the client’s business operations. The optimized websites, faster page speeds, and seamless user experience resulted in enhanced customer satisfaction, leading to increased customer loyalty and retention.

Revolutionizing Online Presence for the Marketing Industry
Australia
Location
2
Team Size
Marketing
Industry
Netsmartz revolutionized online campaigns through advanced sentiment analysis and summarization, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimized marketing strategies.
About
The Company
Our client, based out of Sydney, Australia, emerges as a frontrunner in the marketing realm, dedicated to enhancing online prominence. Their prowess encompasses a spectrum of services, including search engine optimization (SEO), content dissemination, and the orchestration of social media campaigns. Furthermore, they extend their expertise to encompass web crafting, brand identity, and public relations. With a zealous contingent of adept marketers, their mission revolves around steering clientele towards their marketing pinnacles, seamlessly connecting with their intended demographic.
The Tech Stack
React
Django
Team Composition
1 Frontend Developer, 1 Backend Developer
The Problem
Statement
Our client was confronted with the challenge of elevating businesses’ online presence. With a small team, they aimed to utilize React for frontend development and Django for backend functionalities. By integrating APIs from Facebook Meta, TikTok, and Instagram, their goal was to build a comprehensive solution that would empower businesses of all sizes to thrive within the highly competitive digital landscape. Furthermore, they aimed to perform sentiment analysis on comments from their Facebook and Instagram campaigns, utilizing this insight to assess the sentiment of the ongoing campaigns.
The
Challenge
In pursuit of these objectives, our client faced several critical challenges:
The foremost challenge was devising strategies that could significantly enhance businesses’ online presence.
With a small team comprising only two members, maximizing productivity and output was challenging despite resource constraints.
Crafting a comprehensive solution required seamless integration of React, Django, Facebook Meta, TikTok, and Instagram APIs, posing a technological integration challenge.
The solution needed to be versatile enough to empower businesses of all sizes to thrive in the fiercely competitive digital arena.
The
Solution
In response to these intricate challenges, our client needed a sophisticated solution that encompassed several key steps:
We employed the Pattern library in Python to gauge the sentiment of comments, enabling precise sentiment analysis across the campaign’s digital interactions.
Upon completion of sentiment analysis, the next step involved harnessing the capabilities of the Hugging Face API pipeline. This allowed for the automatic generation of concise summaries for positive and negative comments.
The result was a comprehensive yet succinct overview highlighting the campaign’s positive and negative aspects. This overview offered a data-driven insight into the sentiment dynamics by providing corresponding percentages.
Armed with the comprehensive sentiment analysis, our client was equipped to evaluate the campaign’s performance effectively, making informed decisions based on the percentage breakdown of positive and negative feedback.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Identifying Appropriate Resources
The preliminary task was to identify skilled resources to work on the project. Since the project was significantly high-grade – in terms of expertise and skill required, the resources were allocated dedicatedly to see the project through.
Commencing Development
After the resource allocation, the developers started working on the problem statement, defining the benchmarks, fixing bugs and errors, and crafting a better solution.
The
Result
Netsmartz’s innovative sentiment analysis and summarization approach provided a data-driven foundation for informed campaign assessment. This strategic solution enhanced the client’s ability to understand sentiment dynamics and facilitated effective decision-making for optimizing their marketing endeavors.

Additionally, they wanted to ensure that this migration was done with minimal disruption to their business operations, and they were counting on us to make it happen. It was a massive undertaking, but we were determined to help them achieve their goals and provide them with the seamless cloud-based infrastructure they needed to succeed.
The
Challenge
The challenge was to seamlessly migrate the client’s infrastructure while minimizing disruptions to their business operations.
The client’s legacy infrastructure was complex, which made it challenging to identify the specific components that needed to be migrated to the cloud.
During the migration process, the client faced disruptions due to the complex dependencies between different components of their legacy system.
An obstacle to adopting new tools and processes associated with the cloud infrastructure slowed down the migration process.
The client had to ensure that their new cloud infrastructure complied with industry regulations and security standards, which required additional effort and expertise.
The client needed to optimize their cloud infrastructure to ensure that the cost savings promised by the migration were realized. This required monitoring usage and making adjustments to the infrastructure as needed.
The
Solution
Netsmartz conducted a thorough assessment of our client’s existing infrastructure and applications to recommend the most suitable cloud platform for their business needs. After careful consideration, we recommended Azure as the best option.
To ensure a seamless transition to the cloud, we used Azure Resource Manager and Terraform to create infrastructure as code, automating the process of provisioning and configuring resources in the Azure cloud.
We utilized Azure DevOps and Git for continuous integration and delivery, automating the entire software delivery process and reducing the time it took to deploy changes while implementing security measures like two-factor authentication and encryption for the cardholder data.
To migrate the applications and data to the cloud, we implemented a lift and shift migration strategy while using automated testing and monitoring tools to detect and fix any issues that arose during migration.
Finally, we used Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for monitoring and logging, allowing the company to identify and fix issues quickly, ensuring compliance with PCI regulations, keeping track of access to cardholder data, and performing regular audits.
Our
Process
To build a cohesive engagement replete with updates, QA, and feedback loops, Netsmartz followed the following process.
Talent Identification
We started with assessing the client’s requirements and understanding their tech stack and engineering requirements. After a thorough assessment and multiple feedback & interviews, we sorted the candidates for the client’s dedicated team.
Team Allocation
The dedicated team from Netsmartz worked closely with the client to understand their business needs, their existing infrastructure, and the specific requirements for migrating to the cloud. They used industry-standard tools and technologies to create infrastructure as code and automate the provisioning and configuration of resources in the cloud.
The
Result
The solution provided by Netsmartz resulted in significant improvements for our client. Their new cloud infrastructure was highly scalable, flexible, and designed with security and compliance in mind, providing enhanced agility, reliability, uptime, and data protection. Automation of the software delivery process reduced deployment time and effort, resulting in streamlined operations and cost savings.
Overall, our solution provided our clients with a robust, secure, and cost-effective cloud infrastructure that enabled them to grow and succeed in a highly competitive market. We are proud to have been able to assist our clients in achieving their goals and look forward to continuing to provide top-quality IT solutions to businesses.

Netsmartz stand up a dozen resources to build a custom freight logistics ERP solution
Malaysia
Location
12
Team Size
Fleet Management Platform
Industry
Netsmartz’s association with the client was focused on building a custom ERP solution. The client was looking for resources to extend and supplement their current workforce, bringing in a full-fledged, autonomous crew to quicken their ERP platform development.
About
The Company
The client is a leading intelligent road freight platform based out of South Asia. The organization focuses on providing hassle-free booking for a range of ground transportation services. From domestic to cross-border shipments, the client includes freedom of marketplace choice and security as a digital freight forwarder.
The Tech Stack
.NET
Angular
Team Composition
The engagement with the client involved helping them augment their existing team withi
12 .NET & Angular developers
.
The Problem
Statement
The client’s in-house team lacked senior developers, which was the greatest roadblock for the quick roll-out of the client’s ERP platform. To bridge the gap of lack of developers and reduce the platform’s time-to-market, the client approached Netsmartz looking to hire senior developers.
The client wanted to augment their existing team with resources well-equipped with required expertise to help them release the platform quicker.
The client’s primary focus while augmenting the team was to look for reliability in the performance and delivery of the ERP software for fleet management.
The
Challenge
The primary challenge for the client was acquiring reliable & experienced software developers. They were looking for developers with extensive experience in quick and efficient product roll-outs.
Additionally, the software partner needed to hire pre-vetted, knowledgeable developers who could accurately and efficiently help in the early product roll-out.
Another challenge the client faced was hiring a team that could work in their time zone and carefully manage the feature architecture for the ERP platform.
This is where  Netsmartz helped the client with their entire hiring process.
The
Solution
Netsmartz initiated the engagement with the client by providing them with senior developers proficient in both .NET and Angular for backend and front-end product development.
After the rigorous vetting process, Netsmartz allocated 12 senior developers who helped them in the development of the ERP platform, which ultimately resulted in a fast platform roll-out.
Netsmartz helped them hire a customer success manager who overlooked the customer engagement and customer experience part of the ERP platform.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Resource Mapping and Identification
The client shared the Job Description that clearly depicted the resource requirements to work on the project. The main client requirement was hiring developers experienced in .NET and Angular, and we helped them identify skilled resources to work on the project.
Team Engagement
The developers started working by understanding the client’s requirements and tech stack.
Client Interviews
After the requirement and resource selection, the developers were introduced to the client for further vetting and interviews. The client had three discussions that helped both parties understand each other’s requirements, processes, and methodologies.
Scaling the Team Size
The client’s project manager was overlooking the team. The entire process was kept transparent by deploying the JIRA project management tool.
The
Result
The primary achievements of this project were:
Netsmartz powered the client with its experienced talent pool of .NET & Angular developers.
With the help of 12 senior developers working in their timezone, the result for the client is a better platform roll-out.
The client provides better customer engagement through our talented customer success manager, which helped both parties gain a successful and long-term association.

Frequently Asked Questions
Do you have additional questions?
What is Node JS best used for?
Because of its single-threaded nature, Node JS is best-fit for non-blocking, event-driven servers. Though it was earlier designed for traditional websites and backend API services, now it is commonly used to develop applications (RTAs) with push-based architectures in mind.
With Node.js, you can build complex single-page apps, data streaming apps, chat rooms, browser games, and even do hardware programming. Looking for one, hire us.
When Should You Use Node JS?
You can use Node JS—
If your server-side code requires very few CPU cycles.
If you’re performing a non-blocking action and don’t have an intensive algorithm.
If you come from a JS background & are comfortable developing single-threaded code in the same way that you are with client-side JS.
When choosing the right company for my NodeJS development project, what factors should I consider?
If you’re seeking the best and most cost-effective team of Node JS developers in India or anywhere else, look for the following qualities in a company:
Certified developers with over ten years of expertise in the field.
Developers must have worked on at least ten projects.
Have dealt with clients from at least five to ten different countries.
Offer software solutions within timeline and budget.
With over 10 years of industry experience,
Netsmartz is a reliable
Indian company that provides worldwide technological solutions. It is an excellent choice for the best Node JS development services.
What project management tools do you use?
We use industry-standard project management tools like Jira, Trello, Pivotal Tracker, Asana, etc. Where you will be able to track developers’ productivity and monitor the daily progress of your project. You can create the task, assign the work, and follow the development progress.
What are the must-have skills of Node JS developers?
Strong JavaScript knowledge means your team has a stronghold in the JS language. The following are the skills that a Node JS developer must have:
At least 3 years of Node.JS development experience is required.
Front-end technology knowledge such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
Knowledge of Model-View-Controller (MVC) frameworks like StrongLoop, Sinatra, and Rails; and other frameworks like Koa.js, Hapi, and Total.js.

for the project.
What skills/qualifications are required for an android developer?
You must be familiar with the Android framework internals, UI/UX, programming languages and tools, cyber security awareness, Agile development, Web development languages like HTML 5 and CSS, iOS frameworks, Quality assurance, and testing, and problem-solving skills, to be a successful Android developer and stand out from the crowd.

Netsmartz takes over as the Dedicated Mobile Application team for a client’s CRM solution
Israel
Location
8
Team Size
CRM Services
Industry
Netsmartz powered the Mobile Application Development with iOS, Android, and React Native for the client across product lines – enabling better field operations and servicing.
About
The Company
The client is a Tel Aviv-based organization focusing on service transformation and enhancing customer experience. The client offers a Service Intelligence platform that drives decision-making, provides service insights, and powers tech service providers (technicians and agents).
The Tech Stack
iOS
Android
React Native
Automation QA
Java
Salesforce
Team Composition
The engagement started with
1 Java
,
1 iOS
, and
1 Android developer
. We scaled the team to add
2 QA resources
.
2 React Native developers
and
a Salesforce developer
were also added to the active roster.
The Problem
Statement
The client’s architect had set up the product’s base (iOS, Android, Java backend). The client thus had developed the PoC and MVP of the product. Since they had a foundational level architecture ready, they needed the expertise to scale the product through – Android & iOS front-end and Java development.
In addition, the client wanted a full-scale, end-to-end engineering solution that consisted of a Salesforce developer and QA/QC resources to nip any bugs in the bud.
The Salesforce developer was necessary since they were building a product on top of Salesforce (an AI-based engine to recognize patterns and share solutions) – providing after-market services to a specific industry vertical. Their answer was geared to provide field-level CRM services to track, assess, and solve end-customer issues in collaboration with in-house teams.
The
Challenge
The primary challenge was building a complete solution on a pre-existing architecture/codebase made by their in-house resource. While the resource was available in the process, the knowledge transfer window (time frame) was too little.
Thus the team had to understand the codebase and the architecture and then define functionality and tasks.
We had to work with an overlap in the PST timezone. The tasks, standup meetings, and collaboration efforts were slated in PST to ensure consistent interaction, maintenance of a feedback loop, and milestone updates.
The
Solution
When we started, our team interacted with the client’s in-house team and project coordinator. The process started with the team self-debugging the existing codebase to understand functionality and features.
The client also created user stories in JIRA, consisting of design, functions, and API structures.
The team at Netsmartz went through the sequence of tasks that the client wanted. They then formulated queries and discussion points to consider and assess with the client in standup calls.
After a week’s worth of initial discussions, the team at Netsmartz gathered enough data to start the daily sprints to deliver the product, consider queries and requirements by the client, map progress, share updates on standup calls, and further the project pipeline.
Additionally, Netsmartz brought in a React Native developer to create a mobile application on a different product line – a part of the client’s field operations solutions.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the client’s requirements:
Allocating Appropriate Resources
The preliminary task was to allocate skilled resources to assess the existing codebase and build atop the architecture & requirements shared by the client.
Commencing Development
After the resource allocation, the allocated mobile development resources debugged the existing MVP, started daily standups, set milestones, and crafted a plan to encompass client feedback and functional project needs. Automation QC resources were brought in to power the quality assurance.
Team Engagement
The project coordinator consistently assessed the progress and iterations while taking care of any feedback loops generated on any tenet application. Additionally, a React Native developer was allocated to the project to work on a parallel problem set in a different product line for the client.
The
Result
The primary achievements of this project were:
The Netsmartz team was able to take ownership of the pre-existing codebase, debug it, enhance it and build on top of it – while consistently interacting with the client and shaping the product as needed.
Netsmartz was able to add Automation QA resources  to ensure better UX.
Within 3 months, Netsmartz shaped the product to enable launch plans, thus reducing the time-to-market for the client.

Netsmartz built a Practice-Management Solution for a Healthcare Services Provider in the USA
Springfield, USA
Location
5
Team Size
Healthcare
Industry
Netsmartz worked with HelloPatients as a Software solutions provider for five months. As their primary resource for engineering and QC services, we took over the development of their practice management solution with a team of 5 BYT members.
About
The Company
The client is an enhanced practice management platform focused on successful patient engagement and delivering improved financial results.
Primarily focused on managing patient care for healthcare providers, HelloPatients enables better data management, self-service patient capabilities, and patient engagement.
Furthermore, the client also provides:
Insurance discovery & claims management
Healthcare subscription and customized payments
Patient management – Pre-visit, Pre-care, and Post-care
HelloPatients, as a brand, is well-recognized for its services in the Massachusetts region.
From that starting point, the client partnered with Netsmartz to rebuild their patient management solutions while introducing new features and functionality to their service ecosystem.
The Tech Stack
NodeJS
ReactJS
AngularJS
Team Composition
The team consisted of
2 frontend engineers
,
two backend engineers
, and
1 QC
that took care of testing use cases & software efficiency.
The Problem
Statement
Essentially Hellopatients needed a team to take over their development quality control processes, engineer a scalable and seamless solution, and improve user experience. HelloPatients required resources to maintain their existing Angular solution and redo it in ReactJS. This was essentially a map, build, and scale project in the beginning.
Now, since the client is in the healthcare industry, the integration and processes followed were supposed to comply with a bevy of standards and regulations – like HIPAA, PCI, etc.
This was a critical notion and requirement- for their software partner to be well-versed in the necessary regulations and data management in a compliant, non-intrusive manner.
The
Challenge
The client needed help from an experienced software partner that could tackle development in the healthcare industry in the USA.
The client was looking for a software development partner that could:
Manage their incumbent Angular framework and slowly phase the front end of the portal to React.
Scale their software quickly by offering technical and domain (healthcare) expertise.
Scale and churn team size on demand based on their requirements, customer base and future growth plans.
Provide dedicated QC resources versed in gritting out minor bugs (since healthcare regulations are harsh with the technical requirements).
Additionally, HelloPatients wanted a coupled QC and Development team to streamline their project – while keeping their in-house development in tow of the progress and planning.
The challenge in this engagement was to build a very fluid resource deployment solution with ease of resource flexibility (in hiring and in skillset) since HelloPatients was a young startup with dynamic requirements.
The
Solution
Netsmartz engaged with the client starting with 1 AngularJS developer to understand, dissect, and map their current frontend framework and 1 Nodejs developer to assess the backend APIs.
The first Angular resource deployment was done to review and support their existing portal – the process lasted three months.
Meanwhile, a QC was introduced to assess the production quality of the existing solution, build test cases, and retest older functionality in React.
Once this dedicated team was able to get a thorough understanding of what was and what was expected, Netsmartz rolled out processes and a solution infrastructure helmed by a Project manager to kickstart the development of the project.
At this point, additional team members were introduced, and active development toward the MVP was commenced.
Our
Process
Building Healthcare software meant that Netsmartz had to be extremely precise with the client’s requirements and expectations while being mindful of industry compliances.
Additionally, due to the dynamism that HelloPatients had in its software operations, Netsmartz brought its expertise in flexible engagement and its resource/skill pool to effectively manage development for the client in a highly cost-effective manner.
Starting, Netsmartz followed the following process to serve the requirements of HelloPatients:
Team Engagement
We broke the client’s requirements while mapping their existing software framework. This was essential in recommending the skillset and experience level of resources. After thoroughly mapping of the client requirements, we sorted the candidates for their teams.
Mapping & Vetting Developers
A proper vetting and interviewing process was followed to shortlist candidates for the client. After vetting and interviews, the selected candidates are chosen as dedicated resources for the client.
Solutions Architecture
The client was concerned about the Tech Stack, APIs, and Database and wanted a clear architecture to ensure optimization and growth with no issues. Netsmartz deployed a Solutions Architect to consult for the project and share insights on the best tech stack to use to build scalable software.
Flexible Engagement
Ease of engagement and Netsmartz’s BYT model allowed HelloPatients to scale their requirements, hire on-demand, and switch skills as and when needed.
The
Result
Getting the MVP out quickly was the primary motivation and consideration for the project’s success.
With Netsmartz, HelloPatients built a dedicated staff of developers and QC resources that could increase the code velocity while building the MVP and scaling the solution to full-scale software.
The resources allocated to the client were all experienced and well-versed in the Healthcare industry. Thus, the interaction and collaboration between Netsmartz’s dedicated team and Hellopatients in-house were smooth and seamless.
The client was bootstrapped. Hence, the time-t0-market reduced by Netsmartz added benefit to their launch and further operational growth.
With Netsmartz, HelloPatients tackled the obsolescence of Angular 8 while scaling their patient empowerment software.

People and Culture
Building a Great Culture at Netsmartz, and Enhancing Employee Satisfaction
Documenting the Netsmartz Journey to Be a Great Place to Work
Feb 2023 saw Netsmartz certified as a great place to work. We’ve been working towards building a community that thrives on committing to setting a fine balance between work and play. Netsmartz has been awarded for building and sustaining a High-Trust, High-Performance Culture.
“Netsmartz has always strived to create a positive, supportive, and inclusive work environment where everyone feels valued and appreciated. We believe that this recognition is a testament to the hard work and dedication of each and every one of us.”, said
Manipal Dhariwal, Co-CEO & Founder of Netsmartz.
These forms of acknowledgments are usually few and far between. In fact, every year, Great Place to Work assesses nearly 10000 organizations based on several parameters, including leadership, trust, camaraderie, respect, and fairness.
And this year, we have been recognized as the “Great Place to Work.”
This milestone results from the collective efforts of every employee who has been a part of Netsmartz.
We will continue to commit to creating a positive and inclusive workplace culture.

Frequently Asked Questions
Do you have additional questions?
What are the responsibilities of CRM developers?
A CRM developer is a software developer that specializes in customiZing a CRM system to meet the needs of any organization. They work independently to discover corporate pain points in existing CRM systems and design solutions to address those issues.

Additional modules, bespoke plugins, or a suite of software applications that can interact with existing CRM systems are designed and developed by Dynamics CRM or ERP developers.
Do you offer help with upgrading from MS Dynamics CRM to MS Dynamics 365?

How can I pick the best Dynamics CRM/ERP development company?
If you’re seeking cost-effective yet high-quality Dynamics CRM/ERP developers, you need to hire a reliable outsourcing company. And, to make sure you choose the right one, you must consider the following things:

Frequently Asked Questions
Do you have additional questions?
What is a MERN stack developer?
A MERN stack developer is an expert in Express, MongoDB, React, and Node programs. They are JavaScript experts who handle front-end operations with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS; they even manage backend operations with JavaScript and Node. JS.
Is MERN a full-stack developer?
Yes, MERN is a full-stack application with a 3-tier architectural pattern. It includes- the front-end display tier (React. js), application tier (Express. js and Node. js), and database tier (MongoDB).
Is there a demand for MERN stack?
Yes, the MERN stack is in demand. And, it is because of its Cost-effectiveness. MERN Stack developers are in demand as they use only one language, JavaScript. Investing in professionals with MERN experience is considerably more profitable for businesses.
Which is the better stack: MEAN or MERN?
MEAN stack is a superior choice for large-scale applications, as it creates lightweight JavaScript apps. Whereas MERN stack is the fastest at developing smaller applications.
How can We help you choose a developer for your project?
We collaborate with clients via call and carefully consider their project requirements. Then, we start our research to get the best qualified and experienced developer to work on your project with a well-established IT setup. We just shortlist the best candidate that goes with your project, but the final call is yours by taking interviews, going through their portfolios, and communication skills.
If the expertise of a hired developer does not produce the desired result and you want to eliminate a few; or add more developers with a varied skill-set, we will assist you immediately in both cases.

Netsmartz crafts ERP System for Logistics Firm in the US
California, USA
Location
18
Team Size
Transport & Logistics
Industry
Netsmartz started working with the client in June 2021 to initially develop their MVP then move on to their full-fledged production system – that is, their end-to-end hauling solution – replete with functionality and features necessary for the industry.
About
The Company
The client is a logistics and transport platform that provides software for hauling system management. Offering a one-stop complete suite of CRM, Dispatching, Reporting, and Billing services, the client makes it easier for its clients to track, report, and assess a fleet of vehicles.
Offering a mobile-first system backed by a robust solution, the client provides essential functions necessary for:
Customer Management
Data-driven Fleet Management
Tracking & Assessment of Fleet Performance
Billing Automation
To build comprehensive software based on these requirements, the client partnered with Netsmartz to add skilled & experienced developers through our staff augmentation model.
The Tech Stack
Java
Springboot
ReactJS
Android
Automation using Cucumber
Team Composition
Headed by an Engineering manager, Netsmartz deployed
6 Java developers
,
5 ReactJS developers
,
4 Automation QA resources
, a dedicated QA manager and
2 Android developers
.
The Problem
Statement
The client wanted complete development, from scope to MVP to full-fledged product design and development, done by a single software development partner.
The client already had a barebones UI established and built on Figma and wanted their development partner to tinker with it, explore the gaps in it, and suggest the best UX for their product.
Thus, Netsmartz had to begin from scratch – from laying down the software’s architecture to developing features in different sprints (delivering features per sprint in a truly agile manner).
The
Challenge
The primary challenge was introducing, vett, and build a large team of developers, managers, and QA resources in a quickly (over a weekend).
Since the client had extensive requirements, Netsmartz needed to introduce and deploy a cohesive unit for further software development and scaling of the product.
Additionally, since the client wanted an entire ecosystem of solutions across platforms (Android app, Software, MVP), the seamlessness of code, functionality, and knowledge transfer had to be ensured from the start. That meant no wiggling of resources and a dedicated developer allocation.
This further necessitated the deployment of a Project manager and a QA manager.
Since the client was funded, they were objective and precise with their investment and Netsmartz’ required role.
Furthermore, the client was onboarding its 1st customer within four months. Thus, the time-to-market was steep.
The
Solution
Netsmartz started with a team of 6 developers to begin working on the software architecture. Soon after, the engineering manager and QA manager were introduced, and the team started planning the feature development and QA processes, respectively.
The Engineering manager was instrumental in setting up the roadmap leading to the MVP completion and further planning for a full-scale product. At the same time, the QA manager focused on setting up QA processes, along with the planning to bring automation testing into the loop.
The rest of the team of 6 developers and 4 QA engineers were brought in to move toward the MVP.
With the MVP development started, the Engineering manager and QA manager could concentrate their effort on setting up a roadmap for the entire system.
After that, the developers focused on sprints to push out features – thus making way for the entire product to take shape.
All the ceremonies of True Agile were practiced in developing this solution – Sprint Planning, Sprint Demo, Sprint retrospective, and Daily SCRUM.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Identifying Appropriate Resources
The preliminary task was to identify skilled resources to work dedicatedly on the project. Since the project was intensive in its requirements, the early allocation of the engineering manager & QA manager (Senior resources) was done to lay the foundation for the project.
Client Interviews
After the resource selection, the developer candidates were introduced to the client for further vetting and interviews. This process also included getting the developers acquainted with the client, their requirements, their processes, and their methodologies.
Team Engagement
Post the team selection; we started by assessing the client’s requirements and understanding their tech stack and engineering requirements.
Scaling the Team Size
After the initial phases were done and the MVP was built, Netsmartz introduced more developer resources to scale the project.
The
Result
The primary achievements of this project were:
Setting up the team and deploying dedicated resources over a weekend.
Enabling quicker MVP development – thus significantly boosting the time-to-market, which further leads to fast customer onboarding.
Customer onboarding and the client reached an ARR of $1M less than a year from the first line of code being written.
The faster time to market & overnight team setup was enabled by Netsmartz’s extensive pool of experienced and skilled resources as well as our flexible, on-demand engagement models.
Since the project had a steep deadline for the MVP, the resource allocation was intensive, including sessions with the client’s subject matter experts, increased code velocity, and overtime spent.
This allocation was helmed by 2 Senior resources – the Engineering Manager and the QA Manager – which led to successful sprints and high performance from the entire team.
Additionally, the suggestive approach adopted by the team helped improve the product as we progressed along with the development.
The expertise brought in by the Engineering Manager helped Netsmartz recommend and build additional features that were viable for the client for both customer onboarding and scaling of the product.
Furthermore, the original architecture built by the team helped the client scale their product to a large user base and not rely on hardware resources for performance (limited server resources).

Netsmartz delivered SaaS-based Solutions to a US-based Automobile Title Management Firm
Ohio, USA
Location
15
Team Size
Digital Title Management/ Insurance
Industry
Netsmartz has been working with the client since April 2021 supporting the development, testing, and maintenance of two SaaS platforms focused on auto registration and insurance services.
About
The Company
The client is a recognized leader in the title management ecosystem operating in the automotive, insurance, and financial services space.
Delivering title management services via their SaaS platforms, the client digitizes the title processes for movable assets – focusing on simplifying & modernizing a rather tedious industry process. The client partnered with Netsmartz to craft and develop their SaaS-based solutions, add development resources through our staff augmentation model, and get assistance in delivering a solution for their automotive, insurance, and financial services.
The Tech Stack
Springboot
Blockchain
Hibernate
Microservices
Rest
Selenium
JPA
Cammunda
RabbitMQ
Team Composition
Helmed by
1 Project Manager
,
the team comprised of
10 Engineers
and
4-5 QA Specialists
working primarily on Java and Selenium.
The Problem
Statement
The client was looking for a global technology partner to augment their existing software teams. Being a funded scale-up, they were precise on their requirements for a partner that would help them scale their software development team, deliver on a long-term engagement, map and build on their needs, and develop & support their SaaS platforms.
With some specific engineering and tech stack requirements, they were also actively looking for an organization that could deploy and test on their definitive hardware specifications.
The
Challenge
Capital management, long-term engagement, and a scalable partner the client can work with for their IT team extension were critical requirements of the client.
The client was looking for an organization that could help them tackle the below-mentioned challenges and find a suitable solution:
Addressing the lack of skilled resources at an aggressive price
Streamlined processes and dedicated teams that worked collaboratively with the client’s IT team
CI/CD testing and automation testing skills
Specific hardware and development environment requirements
The
Solution
Netsmartz engaged with the client to develop their first product- title registration software. Once a dedicated team was established, we set up another team to support their second product, which was targeted more toward their insurance service ecosystem.
The initial engagement consisted of a team of 8-9 engineers. After developing and stabilizing the first product, we moved over and took ownership of the second product. To this date, two separate teams are managing and supporting the day-to-day operations of the solutions offered by us.
Our
Process
Building exact SaaS platforms in the digital title space ecosystem, Netsmartz followed the following process to serve the requirements of the client:
Team Engagement
We started with assessing the client’s requirements and understanding their tech stack and engineering requirements. After a thoroughly mapping the client requirements, we sorted the candidates for their teams.
Matching the client’s processes
The client had its processes, methodologies, and tech stack. To ensure that the processes and systems were followed, we made sure that the team was introduced to and made familiar with the client’s requirements. The engagement included Sprint planning, introduction to standard collaboration tools, and more.
Mapping & Vetting developers
A proper vetting and interviewing process was followed to shortlist the candidates for the client. After vetting and interviews, the selected candidates are chosen as dedicated resources for the client. The resources were working from global offices with an overlap of the US timezone.
Management of resources
A skilled project manager was allocated and tasked with managing the resources, the requirements, and the day-to-day operations. Additionally, the project manager worked to hold regular SCRUM meetings and manage the deliverables.
The
Result
Since the client was funded, they required a better strategic investment in establishing a dedicated software team. Netsmartz helped them have their processes objectively defined and delivered solutions through an autonomous expert team.

The client required an Augmented Reality interface to deliver visuals for a home renovation firm
North America
Location
14
Team Size
Industry
Netsmartz’s engagement with the client was to amalgamate Microsoft dynamics and Augmented Reality while digitally transforming the otherwise traditional business model of this leading bath manufacturer organization.
About
The Company
With a motto of “don’t be right, get it right,” the client embodies a spirit of continual improvement while integrating innovation to make the bath fitting more innovative. The client’s mission is to make people smile every time they see their bath.
The Tech Stack
.NET
Android
iOS
React
PHP
Microsoft Dynamics
JAVA
Team Composition
The team consists of Quality Analysts, Designers, .NET Developers, Microsoft Dynamics Developers, JAVA Developers, Android, React, and PHP Developers.
The
Challenge
The client faced a challenge of augmenting their existing team with resources well-versed with Augmented Reality and Microsoft Dynamics. This is where the client approached Netsmartz after a long turmoil for finding the right resources in Canada and US.
The primary requirement for the client was to bring in ERP & CRM expertise in addition to mobile integrations in their existing team.
Furthermore, they were looking for an organization to help them digitally transform their business operations by introducing augmented reality-based mobile integrations. 
Along with innovation, the client was also looking for a team that can help them  build a cost-effective solution.
The
Solution
Netsmartz started with a team of three professionals that initiated the project. The resources are well-versed with Microsoft dynamics, .NET, Android, and iOS development.
In 16 months, the team expanded from three to fourteen people, including designers, Quality Analysts, JAVA, React, and PHP developers.
The team integrated the required functionality to build robust ERP and CRM software for clients to help them manage their inventories. Furthermore, JIRA was deployed to overlook the progress of the project.

Team Management
Netsmartz’s BYT model helped the client build the product from scratch while leveraging our domain expertise. Appropriate work goals were set and managed through JIRA software.
Scaling the team size
As per the rolling resources engagement, the team was scaled to a total of 14 resources and churned on-demand as and when the project progress.
The
Result
The primary achievements of the project were;
Netsmartz enabled the client to leverage their expertise to develop an innovative AR-based product that would enhance the consumer experience for the client.

﻿
A software firm leveraged Netsmartz’s Staff Augmentation to add Resources to scale Operational Capabilities
2013-2019
Duration
10
Team Size
Software
Industry
Netsmartz started its engagement with the client to augment its existing development capabilities. The engagement was focused on increasing the workforce to scale their operations and manage workload and production.
About
the Company
It is a Denver-based IT company that provides products and services using multiple technology stacks to tackle mobility and Automation challenges using technologies like Microsoft.NET and Java. As an organization, they primarily develop Enterprise solutions.
The Tech Stack
Java
ReactJS
.NET
Xamarin
AngularJS
iOS
Team Composition
The initial engagement was just with 1 web developer. Later, the team was 10 members, including functional and technical consultants in web technologies, mobile, and automation.
The Problem
Statement
The client was growing at an unanticipated pace. This resulted in a crunch of experienced resources who could take on additional projects and keep the operations running fluidly. For this purpose, the client required a software development partner that could build them a dedicated team of prevetted, experienced resources – ones who had ample experience in enterprise software development – to take on additional workload.
The client was able to leverage white-labeled resources for their needs and functional requirements.
The
Challenge
The resource requirement was a precarious situation. The client could not hire freelancers or deploy a sweatshop – considering the white-label requirements and the multitudes of compliance issues that creep up with unreliable partners.
Herein Netsmartz came into the picture. Netsmartz was required to allocate experienced developers with an attache for PMs and Business analysts to take accord of the client’s projects. This was not a regular engagement since the task, skill, and experience level required was vast – and on relatively short notice.
This is where Netsmartz’s experienced talent pool pitched in and powered the growth of the client’s operations.
Additional challenges included:
They needed a multi-technology stack of resources for varied projects.
White-labeled resources were to work in a controlled environment to ensure security compliance. It meant infrastructure and a campus/office-like setup.
The
Solution
Netsmartz engaged with the client to augment their in–house staff. It was a white-labeled engagement, i.e., Netsmartz resources worked under the client’s organization, under their tenets and protocols.
The initial engagement was ramped up to a roster of 10 developers – across different tech stacks – taking up various projects.
Netsmartz used the BYT model to create a dedicated multi-technology team for the client.
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) was set up for developers to access the client’s environment.
Netsmartz provided a SPOC who worked within the client’s time zone and assured regular progress.
Our
Process
The end-to-end engagement with the client’s project was in phases.
Team Engagement
The beginning of project was kickstarted with a requirement assessment, allocation plan, and candidate interviews. After thoroughly mapping the client requirements, we sorted the candidates for their teams.
Mapping & Vetting Developers
After the client expressed the need to scale slowly, a proper vetting and interviewing process was followed for a web developer for the client. After vetting and interviews, the web developer worked on the client’s projects. After specific progress and proof of work/methodology, Netsmartz scaled the team to 10 based on the client’s requirements.
Matching the Client’s Processes
The client wanted developers to work under their organizational tenets. And thus, the developers were to follow set processes and methodologies. The engagement included a PM to manage sprints and ensure good collaboration across projects and resources.
The
Result
As a result of Netsmartz’s services, the client can augment their in-house staff – significantly supplementing their efforts – and, eventually successfully deliver the necessary projects.
The Agile processes and a seemingly simple on-demand model allowed the client to add developer resources to their teams without worrying about the infrastructure, the tech-stack expertise, or the reliability of the resources. It further enabled them to expand their operations, take on additional projects, and increase their profitability.

Netsmartz re-engineers a Health & Safety Management Solution from its existing codebase
Rochester, New York
Location
3
Team Size
Safety Software
Industry
Netsmartz’s engagement with the client was to fix an existing desktop software and bring in new features and functionality atop the iOS ecosystem.
About
The Company
The client provides solutions to manage information that enables their customers to have a positive impact on the safety and environmental issues they face. The client serves a varied scope of customers including all levels of government agencies, private industry, and educational institutions – including primary, secondary, and college.
Based in Rochester, the firm has been providing health and safety software services for the last 25 years.
The Tech Stack
iOS
QC
Team Composition
The engagement with Netsmartz was kickstarted with a Project Coordinator, 2 iOS developers, and a Manual QC.
The Problem
Statement
The customer had an existing solution that was being used in the inspection of Nuclear power plants. The solution consisted of a desktop application and an iPad application. They had people who were managing and maintaining the desktop application, but their development team did not have the technical expertise to maintain and enhance the iPad application.
The
Challenge
The primary requirement by the client was to bring in iOS expertise, as well as senior resources who could work on a critical problem statement.
The resources were required to independently understand an existing codebase without any knowledge transition and be able to quickly start making enhancements and fixes.
They were also required to run the desktop application and compare the workflows to identify gaps and bring in their technical expertise – while also adding fixes and features to the iPad application.
The
Solution
Netsmartz introduced a functional project coordinator and a senior iOS developer to identify the requirements and build a preliminary to-do list. After a week’s effort, the 2nd iOS developer and a manual QC were introduced.
The to-do list was prioritized and discussed with the customer and alongside, the developers started the code review to build their understanding.
The manual QC started reviewing the desktop and iPad applications to secure the application, and ensure fluid functionality.
The project coordinator acted as the SPoC for the project and ensured milestone-based engagement and flexibility (in resource allocation) for the entire project.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Identifying Appropriate Resources
The preliminary task was to identify skilled resources to work on the project. Since the project was significantly high-grade – in terms of expertise and skill required, the resources were allocated dedicatedly to see the project through.
Commencing Development
After the resource allocation, the developers  started working on the problem statement, while the Manual QC set forth to define the benchmarks, fix bugs, and errors, and craft a better application.
Team Engagement
The project coordinator consistently assessed the progress and iterations, while taking care of any feedback loops generated on any tenet application.
The
Result
The primary achievements of this project were:
Netsmartz team was able to take ownership of the entire codebase and start working out the requirements and tasks. The client only had backend developer resources, therefore the entire scope of API definition, frontend, and functionality were with the Netsmartz team.
Netsmartz team was able to release version updates for the iPad application frequently enough to ensure customer retention for the end client ie the inspection auditors.

Netsmartz Builds a Data Engine for a Mexican eCommerce Firm
Mexico
Location
2
Team Size
eCommerce
Industry
Netsmartz’s engagement with Merama was primarily to work on data transformation from an existing portal to a new format, which they could then use to carry out high-level data analysis to suggest business notions for a strategic edge to their clients.
About
The Company
Merama is based in Mexico. The firm partners with e-commerce players across Latin America in several categories to accelerate growth and profit by investing millions of dollars in working capital alongside a line of experts who aid in strategic and functional knowledge and proprietary technology to take eCommerce businesses to the next level.
The Tech Stack
Python
Team Composition
The two developers allocated by Netsmartz were Python developers with machine-learning capabilities. To facilitate a seamless engagement, Netsmartz also assigned a project coordinator.
The Problem
Statement
The client wanted a software development partner to work on data.
That included all sorts of data analysis services
(which entailed the ML Python skillset)
.
One of the primary reasons that they wanted to get Netsmartz onboard was the fact that they had a lot of portals to source data from. Thus, they required the additional pair of hands and seasoned engineers who could manage the data analytics front.
Furthermore, the client wanted us to write the algorithms necessary to sift through the data, gather meaningful insights, and deliver a report for analytical purposes.
The
Challenge
Since the skill requirement was high, the client was looking for developers who could look for and suggest data-structural changes that could make the analytics and reporting more seamless.
There was also a big challenge in analyzing and identifying the endpoints where the data could be gathered.
Furthermore, there was an incumbent analysis for all these portals since they were constructed in different manners. That meant that the developers had to assess, and study the data sets (different in all), thus there was a need to find how each of these portals was making the dataset available before the transformation could be applied to it.
The client was funded and required a definitive RoI post their engagement with Netsmartz.
The
Solution
Netsmartz started with two developers supported by a data analyst, who doubled up as the project coordinator.
The project coordinator started to review the various portals that were required to be included in the data transformation process.
The team then analyzed each of the portals and their constituent datasets, as well as endpoint APIs, and started creating documentation on how data can be fetched from each of these portals.
The team then proceeded towards creating a central data transformation framework that could cater to the different datasets provided by the individual API endpoints.
Each individual API endpoint was programmed so that the overall data transformation engine could be completed.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Vetting Developers
The preliminary task was to identify senior resources to dedicatedly work on the project. Since the project was intensive in its skill requirements, Netsmartz allocated a project coordinator to ensure seamless collaboration.
Client Interviews
After the resource selection, the developer candidates were introduced to the client for further vetting, and interviews. This process also included getting the developers acquainted with the client, their requirements, their processes, and their methodologies.
Team Engagement
Post the team selection, we started with assessing the client’s requirements and understanding their tech stack and engineering requirements.
Scaling Project
After the initial discovery and assessment, the Senior resources worked on the data transformation project to encapsulate multiple datasets and data sources.
The
Result
The primary achievements of this project were:
Setting up the senior resources to take over the ownership of the project end-to-end, from assessment to building a data transformation engine.
Enabling quicker allocation of resources development – thus significantly boosting the time-to-market.
The data transformation was further used for further projects and data sets – thus making the Engine crafted by Netsmartz resources, the Centralized engine used by everyone in the client’s organization.

Developed an MVP Solution from SCOPE for an Autonomous Dedicated Team for Appify
San Francisco, California, USA
Location
10
Team Size
SaaS
Industry
The client’s organization was founded just three years ago and had its own in-house development team. The bootstrapped organization needed resources to augment and enhance their existing team – getting a full-fledged, autonomous team – to come in, fastrack their product development, and manage their software operations.
About
The Company
The client focuses on providing rapid application development services through a No-code platform. Geared primarily towards Enterprises, the client based in SF, California is a funded startup, having already raised a Series A funding of USD 11.5 Million as of October 2022.
The Tech Stack
Java
ReactJS
iOS
Android
Team Composition
The engagement was led by a
Technical Project Manager
, a
Business Analyst, 6 Developers,
and
2 Automation QA Experts.
The Problem
Statement
The client had a 35+ member development team, who were working on feature development, maintenance, and new client onboardings. As a result, the churn rate for the feature rollout was low.
The client came to Netsmartz, still ambiguous on whether to outsource or hire an in-house team. The primary concern for outsourcing was security, and ramp-up time for the outsourced developers to understand their product.
The client already had well-defined user stories and frameworks, but for new developers, it required in-depth knowledge of the existing product to understand these user stories.
On that note, the client expected the new feature rollout and reliability in performance and deliverables to be the main KPI for the outsourced team of developers.
The
Challenge
The primary challenge for the client was onboarding a reliable software partner. One who could scale a team on-demand and train new members quickly on the product and the required development.
Additionally, it was pertinent for the software partner to have pre-vetted, experienced developers who could emulate & reflect the user stories in their product deliverables.
One additional factor was that of the team management.
The client detested hand-holding and wanted an autonomous team to take care of the end-to-end development. This included addressing and managing feature architecture (case in point, the requirement of a technical project manager), and managing and creating new technical documentation (case in point, the allocation of a business analyst).
The
Solution
Netsmartz kickstarted the engagement with Appify by deploying a Technical Project manager & a Business analyst both of whom instantiated the process of building feature architecture based on the client’s user stories.
The manager identified senior resources who could start reviewing the existing code and understand the path of development and the requisites around the project.
Post this, Netsmartz allocated 6 developers, accompanied by 2 QA resources to act as an autonomous unit for the project.
After the feature architecture was crafted, Netsmartz provided the timeline for when the features would be ready for end-to-end development.
The only participation Netsmartz required of the client was to provide a DevOps resource to deploy the product in their production environment. This was only done to maintain a secure deployment process and assure the security of their overall product offering.
Our
Process
The client needed an autonomous team to augment their existing capabilities. Thus the onboarding and the requirement were pretty streamlined – right from the very beginning. Here is the methodology followed by Netsmartz.
Resource Allocation
Deployment of a Technical product manager and a business analyst to establish the foundation for the project. All the while the Senior resources established the frameworks & milestones for the deliverables, Netsmartz selected and deployed resources for the Development work. This process was kickstarted by the project manager at Netsmartz – and the prevetting and allocation was handled by Netsmartz senior resources.
Management of Resources
Since the team’s work was supposed to be autonomous, the entire ‘resource unit’ allocated managed the processes for the client. The entire scope of the project being based on predefined user stories gave Netsmartz an impetus to drive the Software development. The project manager managed the project direction, ensuring that the deliverable requirement was met, the feature architecture was adhered to and the feasibility of the team and the deployed resources was well-defined.  
                  Additionally, the project manager worked to hold regular SCRUM meetings and manage the deliverables.
The
Result
Since the client wanted an autonomous team to function on its own, Netsmartz resources played a pivotal role.
From taking ownership of the product to managing new feature rollout, and assuring complete security of the entire product itself.
With our dedicated resources, Appify was able to deploy a full-fledged product for their field operations – which helped them provide market-relevant functionality, save money, and drive utility through their application.
Additionally, Netsmartz enabled Appify to build a team on-demand – thus offering much-needed flexibility in the outsourced engagement.
From selecting candidates to managing feature architecture, and from development & QA to crafting technical documentation – Netsmartz took accord with all the requisites and drove the entire engagement from the beginning to the deployment.

The real-estate firm Virtual Manager selects Netsmartz to build their resident portal for launch in a record breaking timeline.
Mobile App Development
Project
Washington DC
Location
Management
Industry
Netsmartz was a long-term partner that assisted with app development, creating a scalable and unique solution to help Virtual Manager stand out against competitors.
About
The Company
Virtual Manager LLC is a lifestyle management and technology firm based out of Maryland. As an organization, they provide varied services for residents living in community associations throughout the Washington, DC, Metro Area.
The Tech Stack
React Native
iOS
Android
Angular
AWS
Team Composition
Along with a bunch of Full-stack developers and
3 mobile app developers
, Netsmartz allocated a dedicated project manager.
The Problem
Statement
App development, Design, and extensive experience with integrations and APIs. That was the primary expectation of the client for their development partner.
The client had scoped out the project for 8 months, in which they wanted to launch it. To that end, they wanted a partner dedicated to their project, with 24×7 support, regular collaboration, daily standups, and updates.
This process that they wanted to be follow also entailed continuous iterations coupled with an Agile Testing process to meet the deadline. Consistent availability, effective communication, and the ability to get the work done were passive addendums that were in place for the project.
Finally, Virtual Manager considered Netsmartz after extensive rounds of research and discussion. Netsmartz’s fluid engagement models and definitive methodology made them feel most comfortable among several other mobile app development firms.
The
Challenge
A couple of years into its inception, Virtual Manager LLC sought to create a strategic edge in its service offerings through cutting-edge applications. One that would be scalable was unique, had great functionality, and redefined its competitive proposition in the real estate industry.
The goal was to get a defined advantage over the competition from an app that could ingress into the regular utility in the consumer sphere – providing easy access anywhere, any time.
On that note, the firm’s CTO focused on organizations that could deliver an app while having a transparent delivery methodology. (Since they did not want to redo the process and invest time, effort, and money again and again) After extensive research and discussions with several other mobile app development firms, Virtual Manager LLC’s Team went with Netsmartz’s services and software team.
The
Solution
With a hands-on approach, Netsmartz decided to segment the app development into different steps –
As a first step, we asked the CTO and his Team a series of questions to ensure that we clearly understood our overall visions and the goals they were looking to achieve. The concept was documented and mapped in detail by our project manager.
We then provided a complete project scope outlining the process, the app’s functionality, the project’s timeframe, and pricing.
After defining the requirements, our project manager crafted a team to deliver the app – focusing on communication, app iterations, and feature additions in regular sprints.
Our Team responded to the feedback and delivered the app.
At the outset, we continued to offer suggestions to make the application better regarding its design, features, updating APIs, and more.
Our
Process
Here’s the process that Netsmartz followed –
Mapping & Vetting Resources
After the scope of development was finalized, Netsmartz allocate a Project manager to act as a SPOC, helm the engagement, and allocated developers to take care of the development requirements for the app.
Collaboration
Netsmartz’s Team, headed by the project manager operated in an Agile manner – with consistent standups arranged for necessary changes and feature additions. As usual, the work happened in collaborative development sprints on top of the feedback, requirements, and architecture that was crafted.
Scaling
As the project grew, more developers were added to take care of feature development, manage QC, and roll out software features regularly. Considering the steep deadline, the team worked in conjunction to ship features first and optimize them later. The flexible scaling also allowed Netsmartz to shorten the time to market – significantly adding a business advantage for the client’s operations.
The
Result
The app Netsmartz created for Virtual Manager LLC successfully positioned the company ahead in the market.
Within eight months of development, Netsmartz rolled out the project for final launch helping Virtual Manager LLC experience tremendous growth. The app launch further contributed to their success as being recognized as one of the
fastest-growing companies in the United States by Inc. 5000 in 2014

Netsmartz builds Software & Scales Android Application for Healthcare Platform
Rochester
Location
2
Team Size
Healthcare
Industry
Netsmartz’s engagement with the client was to focus on developing new features for the Android offering of their comprehensive platform.
About
The Company
The client is a Rochester-based firm focusing on improving Medical decision-making through visualization – meant to enhance patient care, enhance diagnostic accuracy, aid therapeutic decisions, and improve patient safety.
The client aims to expand into a medical intelligence platform that enhances diagnosis for clinicians.
The Tech Stack
Kotlin
Android SDK
Team Composition
The engagement started with 2 full-time Android Developers along with a Project Manager allocated as dedicated resources to the client.
The Problem
Statement
The client had an existing Android application handled by an in-house resource. However, the resource had to be allocated to other functions thus opening up an immediate to replace the expertise, and bring in a dedicated Android developer who could expand the application functionality, and add features, while working on maintenance and support.
The first item that the client wanted to tackle was the upgradation of 3rd party frameworks, and libraries to manage all version updates, and avoid the obsolescence of their application. Thus, time was of the essence, since the client did not want to lose customers because of the tedious, and less effective code.
The
Challenge
Since the application operated in the Healthcare space, the client had to focus on the regulations and the compliances that were mandatory. Thus, the code was not available on a local machine but was rather worked on in a remote setup to ensure data protection.
With this constraint, the client and Netsmartz worked together to choose Amazon workspaces as a development platform, that had all the necessary compliance measures. In this manner, the developer could work actively on the application without the need to fiddle around with data limitation measures.
This allowed the collaboration to be effective while highlighting the methodological expertise of Netsmartz in tackling data security and healthcare software solutions.
The
Solution
Netsmartz identified the requirements of the client and ascertained the scale, expertise, and skill set required for the engagement.
The expectations warranted experienced developers in a phased manner – the first Android developer to lay and assess the foundation of the application while focusing on upgrades (per the version updates), and the 2nd to scale the application, add features, and quicken the code velocity for a faster time to market.
On this note, the developers used were also vetted so as to pick the ones that had adequate experience working in developer environments while maintaining data integrity.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Identifying Appropriate Resources
The preliminary task was to identify skilled, self-starting developers to work on the project. Since the expertise required was tethered to the industry vertical as well as required data security – senior resources were allocated after prevetting, and interview assessments.
Commencing Development
After the developer allocation, the existing code assessment and documentation  started. The developer set up milestones, and targets, with the project manager, and worked on the expectations set by the client.
The
Result
Netsmartz was able to provide the customer with on-demand Android expertise and a resource set that was well-versed in managing critical data security.
Furthermore, with Netsmartz’s Agile methodology, the client was able to leverage the resource skillset to upgrade and launch at a great pace – thus opening the avenue of scaling quickly and maintaining the existing customer base.
Additionally, with a flexible engagement model – customized for the client’s project, the client was able to overcome their hesitation in hiring remote resources.

Industry
Netsmartz expertise enabled a fintech company to seamlessly migrate from on-premises Openshift to Amazon EKS, upgrade VM microservices, integrate Lambda and API Gateway for credit card APIs, and leverage PingOne SSO and CyberArk for enhanced security.
About
The Company
The client, a fintech company specializing in payment solutions, aimed to modernize its infrastructure and enhance security while optimizing services. They partnered with us to migrate from on-premises Openshift to Amazon EKS, upgrade microservices, and integrate serverless components for credit card APIs.

The Problem
Statement
Migrating from an on-premises Openshift environment to Amazon EKS presented challenges in ensuring seamless scalability while minimizing service disruptions. Upgrading legacy VM-based microservices to a new version and migrating selected microservices from VM to Openshift posed challenges regarding compatibility, data migration, and ensuring consistent performance throughout the migration process.
The
Challenge
While undertaking this endeavor, we recognized multiple challenges like:
Integrating credit card APIs using Lambda functions and Amazon API Gateway required addressing challenges related to serverless architecture design, efficient scalability, cost-effectiveness, and managing the operational intricacies of serverless components.
Integrating PingOne Single Sign-On (SSO) and CyberArk for enhanced security introduced challenges related to proper configuration, ensuring a smooth user experience, and effectively managing access control and authentication across the newly migrated infrastructure.
Utilizing Terraform, Ansible Tower, and AWS CodePipeline for infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and CI/CD pipeline establishment posed challenges in terms of defining consistent automation processes, minimizing deployment errors, and ensuring a reliable and efficient software release lifecycle.
The
Solution
Netsmartz devised an intricate solution encompassing Openshift to EKS migration, microservice upgrades, Lambda and API Gateway integration, and enhanced security using PingOne SSO and CyberArk.
We comprehensively assessed the client’s existing infrastructure and application landscape. Based on the analysis, we formulated a migration strategy to transition from on-premises Openshift to Amazon EKS, ensuring minimal disruptions and maintaining service availability.
We implemented a phased approach to upgrade VM-based microservices to a new version. Simultaneously, selected microservices were migrated from VM to Openshift, leveraging Kubernetes’ container orchestration capabilities.
For credit card APIs, we integrated Lambda functions with Amazon API Gateway. This serverless architecture ensured efficient scalability, reduced operational overhead, and enhanced cost-effectiveness.
We integrated the PingOne Single Sign-On (SSO) cloud platform to enhance access security and user convenience across the newly migrated infrastructure. This improved the user experience while maintaining robust security standards.
CyberArk was employed for password rotation and secure management of credentials. This provided a robust approach to safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining regulatory compliance.
We used Terraform and Ansible Tower for infrastructure provisioning and configuration management, ensuring consistency and automation in resource deployment.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines were established using AWS CodePipeline, enabling automated and reliable software releases.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Identifying Appropriate Resources
At Netsmartz, we conducted a detailed analysis of the project’s scope and requirements to determine the appropriate resources to be assigned to the project.
Team Engagement:
The team was provided training for a week before they started working with the client. This involved understanding the client’s niche and requirements. The learning curve enabled them to generate 95% accuracy.
Consistent Client Feedback & Action
At Netsmartz, we prioritize listening to our client’s feedback and concerns. We responded promptly to client feedback, acknowledging receipt and providing action updates. This allowed us to maintain a strong client relationship and ensured that we addressed any concerns or issues they may have promptly and effectively.
The
Result
Netsmartz achieved transformative outcomes for the client’s operations: a seamless migration from on-prem Openshift to EKS, ensuring Kubernetes scalability; phased microservice upgrades and VM-to-Openshift migration for modernized services; optimized credit card API integration via Lambda and API Gateway; elevated security with PingOne SSO and CyberArk; streamlined processes with Terraform, Ansible, and CI/CD; and compliant, secure handling of sensitive data. This DevOps collaboration empowered the fintech to enhance efficiency, scalability, and security, fostering innovation in the competitive landscape.

Configuring a Cloud-based Compensation Management Program for Fintech Software Company
Canada, US
Location
4
Team Size
Fintech Software
Industry
Netsmartz navigated the complexities of the compensation program and configured a cloud-based compensation management program for continuous improvement of the user experience and expanded functionality.
About
The Company
The client operates in the Fintech Software services and offers a subscription-based pricing model. The company is focused on providing businesses with an integrated platform that streamlines the compensation cycle while improving accuracy, transparency, and employee engagement. Their solution is designed to help businesses simplify their compensation processes, ensure compliance, and provide real-time reporting and analytics.
The Tech Stack
.NET Core
Telerik Controls
Javascript/Jquery
SQL
Azure
Team Composition
1 Business Analyst, 1 Quality Analyst, 1 Scrum Master, and 1 Dotnet Developer.
The Problem
Statement
The client faces challenges related to their compensation management process, including inefficiencies and over-processing. These issues result in resource drain and loss of valuable time. Due to the diverse needs of each client, there is a need for a highly flexible framework that can be configured to meet unique requirements in terms of data models, workflow, and processes. The existing compensation programs need tailoring to ensure a customized and reliable client experience, addressing these complex issues effectively.
The
Challenge
The most significant challenge we faced was the modification of the compensation program, which was unique in terms of its data models, workflow, and business processes. Furthermore, integrating the program with various HRIS systems, such as Workday and SAP, posed a challenge and required significant time and effort to ensure seamless data transfer between systems.
The
Solution
The client gained a clearer understanding of the product development process.
The transparent view of the current and future product development helped the client devise a more effective marketing strategy.
The integration led to better financial management for the client and seamless third-party integrations.
The client achieved improved data accuracy and consistency across all systems, as well as streamlined data transfer and processing.
The integration saved significant time for the client and provided real-time visibility into compensation data, enabling better decision-making and reporting.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Brainstorming
The team conducted thorough brainstorming sessions to gain a deep understanding of the client’s existing business processes and identify opportunities for expanding the features of our compensation program post-integration.
Project Planning & Launch Plan
After understanding the business requirements, our team modified the compensation program to meet the specific needs of the client. This involved extensive backend and frontend work, as well as integration with other HRIS systems, including Workday and SAP, through the use of APIs.
Team Deployment & Agile Methodology
The deployment of the team, which comprised developers, QA professionals, project managers, and scrum masters, was done for efficient application development. We followed the Agile methodology to execute the project; the sprint planning and task management are monitored using Azure Boards.
The
Result
Netsmartz not only helped set up a team of seasoned professionals with expertise in research to navigate the complexities of the compensation program and ensure its proper modification and integration but also dedicated themselves to the implementation and ongoing support.  This allowed for continuous improvement of the user experience and expanded functionality, while the team’s well-planned approach led to a firm grasp of the system and the smooth and efficient implementation of every module within the allotted sprint timeframe.

Optimizing Costs and Enhancing DevOps Support for a Fintech Company
Australia
Location
14
Team Size
Fintech
Industry
Netsmartz’s expertise transformed a dynamic fintech company by delivering cost optimization strategies and bolstering DevOps support, resulting in improved operational efficiency and increased.
About
The Company
The client is an innovative player in the fintech sector, specializing in providing cutting-edge financial solutions. With a focus on staying agile and cost-effective, they engaged our DevOps services to streamline operations, optimize costs, and receive robust DevOps support.
The Tech Stack
DevOps
React
Node.JS
Java
Team Composition
12 Developers, 2 DevOps Engineers
The Problem
Statement
The client’s existing setup was not aligned with best practices, leading to unnecessary expenditures and resource wastage. The company’s infrastructure needed modernization to meet industry standards and ensure scalability.
The
Challenge
While undertaking this endeavor, we recognized multiple challenges like:
The absence of a structured cost optimization strategy prevented the company from effectively managing its cloud resources.
The company lacked dedicated DevOps support, impacting its ability to maintain a reliable and responsive development and operations environment.
The company faced intense competition and needed to enhance its agility, innovation, and cost-effectiveness to stay ahead in the market.
The
Solution
Netsmartz collaborated closely with this company to implement a comprehensive solution encompassing cost optimization strategies and enhanced DevOps support.
We thoroughly assessed the company’s existing infrastructure, identifying areas where costs could be optimized through resource right-sizing and adopting more cost-effective services.
Based on the assessment, we devised a cost optimization strategy that involved transitioning to more economical AWS service tiers, leveraging spot instances for batch processing workloads, and implementing auto-scaling to optimize resource utilization.
We introduced Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like AWS CloudFormation and Terraform. This allowed consistent and automated infrastructure provisioning, reducing manual interventions and configuration drift.
Our DevOps team became an extension of their company’s operations, providing continuous monitoring, incident management, and proactive support for their development and operations teams. This included regular maintenance tasks, performance optimization, and incident response.
We established a continuous improvement cycle, regularly reviewing the infrastructure and identifying further opportunities for optimization. This involved recommending architectural changes, adopting new services, and optimizing workflows.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Identifying Appropriate Resources
At Netsmartz, we conducted a detailed analysis of the project’s scope and requirements to determine the appropriate resources to be assigned to the project.
Team Engagement
The team was provided training for a week before they started working with the client. This involved understanding the client’s niche and requirements. The learning curve enabled them to generate 95% accuracy.
Consistent Client Feedback & Action
At Netsmartz, we prioritize listening to our client’s feedback and concerns. We responded promptly to client feedback, acknowledging receipt and providing action updates. This allowed us to maintain a strong client relationship and ensured that we addressed any concerns or issues they may have promptly and effectively.
The
Result
Through our strategic partnership with the client, we achieved substantial operational improvements. Cost optimization strategies led to significant savings, while Infrastructure as Code enhanced efficiency and minimized errors. Our robust DevOps support boosted reliability, minimized downtime, and proactive incident management ensured smooth operations. The optimized setup also empowered the company with scalability and agility, driving competitiveness in the fintech market.

Netsmartz helps create a ubiquitous solution for a Freight Management Services company
Australia
Location
2
Team Size
Transportation & Logistics
Industry
Netsmartz started working with the client in 2021. It helped design, develop, and implement new features in the customer’s proprietary Transport Management Software (TMS). Our client is a logistics company with Tech at the heart of its logistics operations.
About
The Company
The client is an Interstate Freight Management Services Company, which has evolved dramatically into Australia’s fastest Transport Management Software (TMS), which provides a platform to integrate various Carriers across the country.
The goal is ultimate visibility on all Shipper’s freight movements, live rate comparison, and real-time custom reporting.
The Tech Stack
Vue.Js
Java
Springboot
JPA
Hibernate
Docker
AWS
Jira
Github
Sonar
Cypress
Team Composition
2 Full Stack developers
The Problem
Statement
For shippers, choosing the best carrier for a particular destination, among options in the local market, is one of the biggest challenges. The client’s TMS is designed to solve this problem and integrate all carriers and related services in one place. However, this integration brings challenges as the system must be seamless yet accept different information formats. Hence, there was a need for a user-friendly, platform-independent solution that could be developed using the latest tech stack at scale.
The
Challenge
Working with several carriers was challenging because each carrier can have different operating procedures and logistics. Due to the lack of any standard process, it’s challenging to bring together all carriers in one place. Also, managing the preferences of different customers and clients was a monumental task.
Communicating with systems that may accept different data and information formats takes time to manage. To solve this problem, the system was designed to provide some standard services like Reporting, Invoicing, Email notifications, Printing, Customer – Client – Carrier registrations, etc. Also, it provides different integration layers to communicate with different carriers. And these integration layers communicate with a standard backend system.
The
Solution
At the Frontend, there was a joint presentation layer for Customers and users, further defined and categorized by customers. The front end was highly customizable according to the customer’s needs; for example, they could choose their time zone depending on their state (even country on a global scale), and it could then configure Printers and email settings. Integration with different carriers can also be managed at the customer and client levels.
Also, the features provided can be restricted based on the user profiles designated by the customers. A Super Admin system view was also provided.
This standard frontend layer now communicates with the client’s backend service, which communicates with different carrier systems through integration and standard services.
Data and information from different carrier systems were transformed to and from the backend system. Some of the features we developed:
User Onboarding
Customer Onboarding
Carrier Onboarding
Consignment Tracking
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Identifying Appropriate Resources
The solution required experienced developers who could understand the client’s requirements and provide a practical solution in sync with the industry standards within the deadlines specified by our client. Netsmartz identified experienced developers within its pool of 1000+ employees and helped deliver the project on time.
Team Engagement
The Team engaged with different stakeholders from the client side and understood the client’s goals. Regular engagement with the client ensured the project ran smoothly in an agile environment.
Client Interviews
After the resource selection, the developer candidates were introduced to the client for further vetting and interviews. This process also included getting the developers acquainted with the client, their requirements, processes, and methodologies.
The
Result
The primary feature achievements of this project were:
A robust, highly efficient, customizable system designed for all stakeholders.
A system designed to be scalable to any geographical location and any carrier.
A solution powered by the latest technologies, enabling Consignment Tracking
Highly Interactive and user-friendly solution based on Modern web design standards.
One Touch Printing to print consignments and manifest labels.

Netsmartz crafted a Complete Real Estate Transaction Management Solution
Colorado
Location
13
Team Size
Real Estate
Industry
Netsmartz was engaged to deliver a complete real estate transaction management solution replete with contract & data management functionality.
About
The Company
The client is a real estate company that powers realtors with smart technology and provides impact-driven tech solutions to the industry’s secure and high-utility applications. The organization is a strong player in the real estate industry and is bringing a cutting-edge solution to property management for seamless compliance and transaction.
The Tech Stack
Java
ReactJS
.NET
Xamarin
AngularJS
iOS
Team Composition
The team for Resure comprised
7 developers
,
1 PM
,
3 QA experts
,
1 technical admin
, and
1 Data security expert
.
The Problem
Statement
Real estate as an industry has a lot of inertia and slow-moving parts. To this end, Resure wanted to deliver a comprehensive and holistic solution to manage a Realtor’s management requirements – including transactions, contract management, and secure compliance through an all-encompassing dashboard.
The end expectation was that of a transaction management solution that would offer a feature-packed ecosystem that can create contracts, manage & change documents, and provide geographical, and biometric security features.
The
Challenge
The primary challenge in crafting the solution was to cover all aspects of transaction security for access, authorization, data in motion, and data storage.
Additionally, Netsmartz was required to build a visual dashboard that provides Maximum Situational Awareness and Transaction Progress (Who, What, When, Where, Why).
Furthermore, the client also required us to focus on:
Creating an Easy to Read colorful dashboard.
Fully Responsive ecosystem with full-scale data interaction and rapid data response.
Minimal & Clean UI to accentuate the UX and the functional aspects of the software.
Since the engagement had to have a security component in place to ensure compliance, Resure could not just hire freelancers or deploy a developer sweatshop.
They needed reliable partners with experience in managing data compliance and security issues.
Herein Netsmartz came into the picture. Netsmartz was required to allocate experienced developers with PMs and Business analysts to take accord of the client’s projects.
This is where Netsmartz’s expertise was instrumental. From our flexible engagement models to dedicated development resources and a self-sustained team unit with PMs, QA, and Technical expertise to power the growth of the client’s operations.
The
Solution
With a hands-on approach to the solution, Netsmartz decided to segment the software development into different steps –
Brainstorming and requirement mapping per the project’s road map.
Team deployment to work on the application providing development services, QA, and project management to deliver the application.
Programming the visual dashboard providing maximum situational awareness and transaction progress (who, what, when, where, why).
Working on the track’s progress and the correct & compliant execution of the real estate transaction solutions as per the client’s requirements.
Crafting a document outline view in hierarchical format for convenient reference.
Our
Process
The end-to-end engagement with Super 7 UI was in phases
Team Engagement
The engagement was kickstarted with a requirement assessment, allocation plan, and discerning what sort of candidates and technical stack to utilize. After thoroughly mapping the client requirements, we positioned the candidates for their teams.
Mapping & Vetting Developers
Post-requirement assessment, proper vetting, and interviewing processes were followed. After vetting and interviews, the developers started working on the client’s projects.
Matching the Client’s Processes
The developers followed a set of processes and methodologies predetermined by Netsmartz and customized as per the client’s needs. The engagement included a PM to manage sprints and ensure good collaboration.
The
Result
We crafted an application that Tracks Progress and “RE-Sures” Correct & Compliant Execution of the Real Estate Transaction and builds Lightning offers for Rapid & Automatic Contract creation when viewing Property.
Additionally, Netsmartz also created a compressed contract view that provides seamless reference functionality, document navigation, and better document control.

A publishing company needed a Flexible, Secure, eCommerce Site for the education market
New York
Location
10
Team Size
Education
Industry
Netsmartz was hired for our expertise with the Magento cloud commerce platform to build the firm an eCommerce site that would be flexible and secure and provide the client’s customers and prospects with a great user experience.
About
The Company
The firm is an educational publishing company based out of New Rochelle, New York – with about 1000 employees. The firm focuses on providing classroom-tested solutions that help differentiate instruction and enable better student interaction as well as improved pedagogy. Their programs include content-rich leveled books, differentiated instruction, intervention programs, and professional development.
The Tech Stack
Magento
AWS
MySQL
PHP
jQuery
Team Composition
1 project manager,
5 developers
,
1 senior designer
,
1 technical admin
, and
2 QA resources
were deployed to bring in tech expertise and fluid project management.
The Problem
Statement
The premise of the engagement was to build the firm an eCommerce platform on the cloud that would integrate with their ERP system for three different stores. The purpose of this store was to create an ecosystem where a customer can share an account and session across their product verticals. For this purpose, they required a fluid eCommerce site with exceptional UX and a team with pre-set collaboration methodologies and programming skills.
The
Challenge
The client required an autonomous team that would guide their project, as well as helps them out with the different strategic aspects of the eCommerce system.
Herein, Netsmartz had to bring in a subject matter expert – a resource well-versed in Magento and the education industry. Additionally, the resources required for the project had to have a strong understanding of the eCommerce store scaling, i.e., more in tune with the business end of things.
Thus Netsmartz allocated a project manager to this engagement – to help guide and track the progress of the engagement through pre-defined milestones.
The
Solution
Netsmartz engaged with the client to jumpstart eCommerce development. It was an engagement from scratch, i.e., Netsmartz had to start from the foundations, and the resources had to define tenets and protocols and the technical requirements before getting the programming started.
The foundational architecture was set by the senior resources and the project manager. The engagement was agile, wherein Netsmartz brought in QA resources and designers on a rolling basis (only when required) – keeping the engagement low-cost for the client.
The initial engagement started with 3 developers, 1 project manager, 1 subject matter expert, and a technical administrator. After certain milestones were reached, Netsmartz upped the developer roster to a number of 5.
Netsmartz’s BYT model helped the client build from scratch and leverage our technical and domain expertise.
JIRA was used for tracking work and goals.
Netsmartz provided a SPOC who worked in the client’s time zone.
Our
Process
The engagement with the client’s project was in the following phases:
Team Engagement
Initially, the project launches with a requirement assessment, an allocation plan, and interviews with candidates. After thoroughly mapping the client requirements, we sorted the candidates for their teams and deployed a project manager.
Mapping & Vetting Developers
After the client showcased their requirements and expectations, an interview was followed to hire eCommerce experts for the projects. After vetting and interviews, the project manager worked with the developers on the project.
Matching the Client’s Processes
The client interacted with the project manager and the developers on daily standups and weekly SCRUM calls to assess the progress, share feedback and provide the much-needed perspective on the solution being built.
The
Result
As a result of Netsmartz’s services, the client hired experienced resources with ease and flexibility. The rolling basis engagement allowed them to add resources as and when needed – thus reducing initial investment and lowering their TCO.
It further added to their profitability since they could significantly supplement their strategic efforts with the technical talent provided by Netsmartz.

I Want to Improve My Customer Experience
and CSAT Scores
We get it—providing great customer support is tough. From building and growing our own SaaS products, we’ve seen these challenges up close.
Some of the biggest issues support teams face that you can solve with our help are:
Time Zone Diversity
Supporting customers around the world means you need a team that’s available 24/7
Agent Availability
It’s tough to have enough support staff during busy times, slow periods, and weekends while keeping up with service levels
High Agent Turnover
Training new agents takes time and money. When experienced ones leave, it can hurt your operations and customer satisfaction
Limitations of AI
Automation is great for simple questions, but anything more complex still needs a real person
Generic Responses
Customers notice when replies feel robotic. Solving tricky issues requires empathy and a human touch
Rising Support Costs
As your business grows, so do the costs of keeping up with customer support, both in fixed expenses and ongoing needs
We Grow Your Support to Support Your Growth!

Intelligent Customer Support with a Personal Touch

How Netsmartz Eliminated Performance Bottlenecks & Offered Scalability to the Online Retail Industry
USA
Location
13
Team Size
E-commerce
Industry
A leading online retail company partnered with DevOps experts to seamlessly migrate from MageMojo to Kubernetes, enhancing scalability, reliability, and operational efficiency.
About
The Company
The client is a leading online retail company that was established in 1899 and has since become a leading provider of high-quality products. With a customer base spanning 83 countries and exceeding 100,000, the brand has earned a reputation for delivering reliable and effective solutions.  They partnered with our DevOps experts to seamlessly migrate from MageMojo to Kubernetes, enhancing scalability, reliability, and operational efficiency.
The Tech Stack
DevOps
Magento
Team Composition
10 Developers, 3 DevOps Engineers
The Problem
Statement
The existing hosting provider, MageMojo, couldn’t handle the increased load during peak sales seasons, resulting in performance issues and frequent downtime. The infrastructure’s limitations impacted reliability, hindering the company’s ability to maintain a consistent customer shopping experience. The company was concerned about potential disruptions to their operations during migration, as transitioning to a new infrastructure could lead to downtime or glitches.
The
Challenge
While undertaking this endeavor, we recognized multiple challenges like:
Slow application performance affected user experience, potentially leading to customer dissatisfaction and abandoned shopping carts.
Without automated deployment pipelines, code releases and updates were time-consuming and error-prone, hampering the company’s agility in responding to market demands.
The inability to dynamically scale resources based on traffic demand led to resource wastage during low-traffic periods and performance issues during high-traffic periods.
The
Solution
To address these challenges, Netsmartz documented the execution plan for a seamless migration from MageMojo to Kubernetes. The primary focus was on enhancing scalability, reliability, and performance while minimizing any adverse impact on the customer experience.
We thoroughly assessed the company’s existing infrastructure, application architecture, and business requirements. Based on this analysis, a detailed migration plan was devised, outlining the steps, timelines, and potential risks.
We containerized the company’s applications using Docker, ensuring consistency across environments. The applications were then migrated to Kubernetes clusters deployed across multiple regions for high availability and resilience.
Leveraging Kubernetes, DevOps set up automated deployment pipelines using tools like Jenkins and Helm. This allowed them to manage code releases efficiently, conduct A/B testing, and roll back changes if needed, all while ensuring minimal downtime.
Kubernetes’ dynamic scaling capabilities were harnessed to automatically adjust resources based on traffic demand. We implemented horizontal pod autoscaling and integrated Kubernetes with a content delivery network (CDN) for efficient load distribution.
Prometheus and Grafana were employed for monitoring and logging, enabling real-time visibility into the infrastructure’s health and performance. We also set up alerts to promptly detect and address anomalies, further enhancing operational efficiency.
We orchestrated the seamless transfer of data from MageMojo to Kubernetes-based storage solutions. A robust data backup strategy was implemented to ensure data integrity and disaster recovery.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines were established using AWS CodePipeline, enabling automated and reliable software releases.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Identifying Appropriate Resources
At Netsmartz, we conducted a detailed analysis of the project’s scope and requirements to determine the appropriate resources to be assigned to the project.
Team Engagement:
The team was provided training for a week before they started working with the client. This involved understanding the client’s niche and requirements. The learning curve enabled them to generate 95% accuracy.
Consistent Client Feedback & Action
At Netsmartz, we prioritize listening to our client’s feedback and concerns. We responded promptly to client feedback, acknowledging receipt and providing action updates. This allowed us to maintain a strong client relationship and ensured that we addressed any concerns or issues they may have promptly and effectively.
The
Result
Through their partnership with Netsmartz, the client achieved impressive outcomes. The adoption of a Kubernetes-based infrastructure enabled effortless scalability, eradicating performance bottlenecks during varying traffic surges. Kubernetes’ robust features ensured uninterrupted application availability, reducing downtime and enhancing user experience. Automated deployment pipelines streamlined releases, hastening feature launches. This optimization led to cost savings via resource-efficient allocation. The migration positioned the company for future growth, adeptly adjusting to market shifts and technological advancements.

Samsung requested the Spin-Up of a Sizable Elastic Resource Team
2013-2019
Duration
21
Team Size
Electronics
Industry
Netsmartz was tagged by Samsung to deliver a feature-packed marketplace. Initially, Netsmartz allocated a team of 6 team members consisting of developers, QA and Project Manager. The team size has since scaled to 21 remote team members over the last several years.
About
The Company
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a South Korean multinational electronics company headquartered, South Korea. It is a global leader in consumer hand held electronics and white goods. Samsung’s India Online Shop has been managed and maintained by Samsung India Electronics eStore team for several years which strongly backed by its dedicated team at Netsmartz.
The Tech Stack
Apache JMeter
Selenium
Magento
HTML5
MySQL
Amazon Cloud
Team Composition
The team deployed for Samsung consisted of
21 members
– which included Project Managers, Developers, QA experts, and a Subject matter expert.
The Problem
Statement
Samsung urgently needed to revamp its existing online storefront in India and needed a full-fledged skilled team of developers to handle the task.
Additionally, the team had to operate in a controlled environment for security and confidentiality reasons.
Samsung also required us to follow their branding guidelines, thus requiring an experienced team of engineers – skilled in multiple technologies to address multitudes of parameters.
The
Challenge
Since the requirement was immediate, Netsmartz had to set up a dedicated team to jumpstart the development process. Samsung, primarily with engagement, was looking for the following tenets and operational capabilities to address its resource requirements –
The Autonomous team supplemented by a Subject matter expert and a dedicated Project Manager to keep things in line.
Developers across different tech stacks with prior experience in building a marketplace, managing large-scale, data-heavy operations, and high-performance backend systems.
A Testing unit allocated alongside the developer team – to simultaneously deliver on QA and QC requirements.
The
Solution
A Content Management engine was created using Magento and MySQL so Samsung’s Sales teams could put together product details and information speedily in the backend.
Enhanced features like Pre-booking, Notify me, Multiple Payment Gateways, and Track Shipments were implemented, and control was provided to the eStore team.
The website was made responsive, and a single login allows customers to access all of Samsung’s global sites with the same account.
The back-end architecture of the new system was built to scale (hosted on Amazon Cloud) and to tackle high traffic load smoothly. It handles 60 – 70K users every day, and this is only expected to grow exponentially.
The new application has been encapsulated by server-level security modules and a firewall to prevent unwanted intrusions on the website.
Our
Process
To build a cohesive engagement replete with updates, QA, and feedback loops, Netsmartz followed the following process.
Talent Identification
We started with assessing the client’s requirements and understanding their tech stack and engineering requirements. After a thorough assessment and multiple feedback & interviews, we sorted the candidates for Samsung’s dedicated team.
Team Allocation
Netsmartz set up a dedicated team to develop a new storefront for Samsung. An SME (Subject Matter Expert) was appointed to architect the solution. This was necessary to chart the purpose and direction of developer sprints.
Team Engagement
The team followed the Agile process using JIRA to keep track of day-to-day tasks and to provide client visibility. A daily Scrum meeting with the client is part of the process. The Project Manager is the Single Point of Contact (SPOC) who liaised with the client
The
Result
As a result of Netsmartz’s services, Samsung was able to contain multiple storefronts managed through one content management system. This further enabled Samsung to scale their storefronts, manage large amounts of traffic, and add-on plug and play features like multiple payment gateways, distributors, pre-booking, etc.
Furthermore, our Dedicated team model allowed Samsung to add multiple resources to suit their operational requirements easily. Netsmartz’s 24×7 support also helped Samsung handle and solve queries related to Amazon Server, Galera Cluster, and Modsec security.

A global Print Medium Firm hired Netsmartz to build its new customized client portal
Media
Industry
Hong Kong
Location
Web Development
Project
Netsmartz LLC was brought in to create a one-point integration for gallery software and e-commerce companies to connect to a network of photography labs across the client’s targeted markets.
About
The Company
The organization is a paper and media distributor which sells to the photography industry and has a digital imaging platform that is widely used in the North American and Australian markets. The client was keen on establishing an e-commerce market space to serve as their network, and provide a one-stop shop for photo labs, photographers, and photography software vendors.
The Tech Stack
MongoDB
Express
React
Node
Selenium
React Native
Team Composition
The project entailed allocation of
5 full-time developers
, and a project managers on the SCRUM team to work on incremental developmental sprints, a testing phase, and through to the delivery of an MVP.
The Problem
Statement
The client wanted assured scalability options to boot the engagement. Particularly since they had to create an MVP first, and then iterate and add resources as per the customer feedback, and the feature orientation of the application.
On this note, they expected their software development partner to allocate a SPOC, offer a good price, and bring in skilled resources.
Since the engagement was started from an MVP, the client wanted to curtail the cost of development, ie the TCO (total cost of ownership). For that, they required a strategic partner – one who had the infrastructure to house the developers and offer credible services that could enhance their own profitability.
The
Challenge
The media firm’s digital imaging platform is widely used in the North American and Australian markets. However, they still required a comprehensive platform to integrate their services and craft an easier way for companies to establish partnerships with solution providers such as photography production companies and photo websites.
The goal was defined:
Provide consumers with a seamless experience when it comes to ordering, developing, and publishing photos.
To craft that seamless solution for companies and to build a network of service providers, Guy and his team engaged with Netsmartz LLC to create a custom software.
The
Solution
The project had five phases. Starting with a feasibility architecture where the client and his team identified the scope of the project, a business analysis phase where they wrote high-level user stories in collaboration with us, and a SCRUM implementation where we keyed in. The client then focused on acquiring resources from Netsmartz to work on the project in developmental sprints, craft a testing phase for code audit and checks, and finally deliver an MVP.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed its proven routine of vetting, allocation, and collaboration for this engagement
Mapping & Vetting Resources
After the scope of development and testing was finalized, Netsmartz allocated a senior engineer to act as a SPOC, helm the engagement, and allocated developers flexibly to take care of the client’s development requirements. Additionally, the Senior Engineer also placed QA resources to manage bugs, and ascertain the viability of the client’s primary app.
Collaboration
Netsmartz’s team worked in an Agile manner – considering the iterative nature of development, as well as consistent feedback loops set in place. The work happened in collaborative development sprints with our Senior engineer. Netsmartz’s Senior Resource also worked towards creating a seamless collaboration schematic, while reducing the errors and issues on the platform.
Scaling & Reporting
The work and its impact were measured by the velocity of tickets that were being sorted and completed. In that regard, our Senior Resource delivered objective results and helped the organization and its team fix all of the bugs that were on their platform while ensuring seamless development.
The
Result
Netsmartz’s customizable solution enabled the client to scale on-demand – thus eliminating any talent or hiring concerns.
Netsmartz not only took cognizance of their TCO and project runway but also took complete ownership of the project – providing the client with customizable and high-quality resources, much to the delight of their internal stakeholders. Throughout the partnership Netsmartz:
Established additional features
Resized the Scrum team
Sent the product out to early adopters and testers
And has also been hosting and operating the software’s APIs and Azure cloud system
Netsmartz is still working with the Media firm and crafting its platform.

AWS to Azure Migration for Product-Based Company
Canada
Location
18
Team Size
Product Based
Industry
Netsmartz’s proficiency empowered a product-based company to migrate smoothly from AWS to Azure App Service, achieving enhanced operational efficiency and seamless cloud transformation.
About
The Company
The client, a dynamic product-based company, recognized the potential of Azure App Service for hosting their applications and sought our DevOps expertise to guide them through the migration process while ensuring robust operational practices.
The Tech Stack
DevOps
Azure Devops
Team Composition
15 Developers, 3 DevOps Engineers
The Problem
Statement
The client’s existing applications were hosted on AWS, but they were intrigued by the capabilities of Azure App Service for easier application management and scaling. They sought assistance migrating their applications to Azure while enhancing operational efficiency and reliability.
The
Challenge
While undertaking this endeavor, we recognized multiple challenges like:
Migration of client’s applications from AWS to Azure piqued by Azure App Service’s management and scalability perks.
Endeavor to transfer applications to Azure, concurrently aiming to elevate operational efficiency and reinforce robustness.
Client’s existing software infrastructure, formerly residing on AWS, is slated for migration to Azure in pursuit of improved manageability, scalability, and operational resilience.
The
Solution
Netsmartz worked closely with the client to craft a comprehensive solution encompassing AWS to Azure migration and seamless application deployment using Azure App Service.
We initiated by thoroughly assessing the client’s existing applications and architecture on AWS. Based on the analysis, we formulated a migration strategy tailored to Azure App Service, addressing key networking, data migration, and security considerations.
Leveraging Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, we designed infrastructure as code templates to define the Azure App Service resources. This approach ensured consistent and reproducible infrastructure provisioning on Azure.
Our team facilitated the deployment of the client’s applications to Azure App Service, followed by thorough testing to ensure functionality, performance, and reliability in the new environment.
We established automated CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps to streamline deployment. This allowed for efficient releases, rapid iterations, and reduced human errors.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Identifying Appropriate Resources
At Netsmartz, we conducted a detailed analysis of the project’s scope and requirements to determine the appropriate resources to be assigned to the project.
Team Engagement
The team was provided training for a week before they started working with the client. This involved understanding the client’s niche and requirements. The learning curve enabled them to generate 95% accuracy.
Consistent Client Feedback & Action
At Netsmartz, we prioritize listening to our client’s feedback and concerns. We responded promptly to client feedback, acknowledging receipt and providing action updates. This allowed us to maintain a strong client relationship and ensured that we addressed any concerns or issues they may have promptly and effectively.
The
Result
Through collaborative efforts, Netsmartz achieved seamless migration from AWS to Azure App Service, ensuring application compatibility, operational efficiency, and scalability. Azure’s streamlined management reduced overhead, fostering innovation. Infrastructure as code ensured consistency, while CI/CD pipelines enhanced collaboration. This successful transition sets the stage for continued growth and development on Azure.

Will developing or migrating my existing app into PHP help me save time and money?
Yes, if you hire a full-stack PHP developer from Netsmartz, you will be able to migrate and develop an attractive and easy-to-use application right from scratch. This can also help you save time and money that may be spent on advertising.
How do I hire PHP web developers or a team at Netsmartz?
At Netsmartz, here is the procedure we follow;
Jot down all the PHP development tasks you want the developer to complete.
Finalize the deal with the sales team based on the chosen PHP developer and technology.
We’ll set everything up and connect you with the developer once you confirm.
Can I hire a PHP developer for hourly or project-based tasks?
Yes, you can employ a developer on hourly or project-based tasks if you know how much time your task requires. Netsmartz provides the option to adjust the hiring model as per the project.
What’s your pricing model?
Our pricing model is divided into three types;
Dedicated Hiring:
You must pay a one-month advance payment. The payment will thereafter be made monthly beginning with the next cycle.
Hourly Basis:
In this case, you must pay one week in advance, and the remainder can be paid in weekly, fortnightly, or monthly installments.

In this model, you must pay 20 to 30 percent of the project’s cost up in advance. And, the leftover amount is paid after the project is completed.
What is the cost of hiring a PHP developer?
Actually, there’s no direct answer to this. The cost of hiring a PHP developer is determined by a variety of factors, including the development platform, the application type, the design complexity, the number of pages, features, and functionalities, and the cost of maintenance.

From predictive analytics to automated workflows, we streamline processes, enhance decision-making, and strengthen security.
AI-Powered Smart Scheduler
A caregiving agency uses an AI scheduler to assign caregivers to clients based on care needs, proximity, and caregiver skill sets. If a caregiver is unavailable, the system instantly finds a suitable replacement.
Problem
AI Solution
Benefits
ROI
Caregiving agencies face the complex challenge of scheduling caregivers to match clients' unique needs while balancing caregiver availability, skill sets, and proximity. Manual scheduling can result in conflicts, missed shifts, and inefficiencies, often leading to caregiver burnout and reduced productivity. These challenges can significantly impact client satisfaction and care quality, as inconsistent scheduling and overextended caregivers may compromise the level of care provided. A streamlined, efficient scheduling solution is essential to meet client expectations, optimize resources, and enhance overall service quality.
An AI-driven smart scheduler for caregiving agencies intelligently analyzes client care needs, caregiver availability, skills, and location to create highly efficient, optimized schedules. By continuously learning from past scheduling patterns, it adapts in real time to manage last-minute changes, cancellations, or emergencies. This advanced system ensures caregivers are matched to clients seamlessly, enhancing care consistency and reducing scheduling conflicts. With AI handling these complexities, agencies can focus more on delivering quality care and improving overall client satisfaction.
Efficient Resource Allocation:
Matches caregivers with clients based on skill and location, reducing travel time and increasing the number of clients served.
Real-Time Schedule Adjustments:
Instantly adapts to changes, such as cancellations or emergency requests, maintaining continuity of care.
Reduced Caregiver Burnout:
Balances schedules to prevent overworking caregivers, fostering higher job satisfaction and retention.
An AI-powered scheduling solution can boost operational efficiency by 25%, cut travel costs by 15%, and increase caregiver retention rates by 30%. This advanced system streamlines scheduling and significantly enhances client satisfaction through consistent, well-matched caregiver assignments. By reducing administrative workload and optimizing resource allocation, AI scheduling helps agencies operate more smoothly and cost-effectively, fostering a positive work environment that keeps caregivers engaged and clients satisfied.
AI-Based Outbound Voice Caller for Notifications and Reminders
A healthcare provider uses AI to call patients with appointment and prescription reminders, scheduling calls based on preferences. Patients can confirm or reschedule through a conversational interaction.
Problem
AI Solution
Benefits
ROI
Healthcare, finance, and utilities providers require reliable, efficient methods to communicate important updates to clients, such as appointment reminders, bill payment alerts, or service notifications. Manual calling processes are time-consuming and often result in missed messages, leading to unattended appointments, delayed payments, and diminished customer satisfaction. An automated communication solution can ensure timely, consistent outreach, enhancing client responsiveness and overall service quality.
An AI-powered outbound voice calling system automates notifications and reminders precisely, utilizing natural language processing to deliver personalized messages tailored to each customer’s history, preferences, and schedule. Capable of managing high call volumes effortlessly, this advanced solution uses conversational AI to engage clients in a human-like manner, enhancing the customer experience. Intelligent timing adjustments ensure calls are placed at optimal moments to boost engagement rates, making it an invaluable tool for efficient, high-touch communication at scale.
Increased Customer Engagement:
Sends personalized messages with timing optimized for customer availability, increasing response rates and appointment adherence.
Reduced Operational Costs:
Automates large-scale call campaigns, allowing staff to focus on more complex interactions.
Enhanced Customer Experience:
Provides consistent, clear, and timely communication, improving client satisfaction and loyalty.
Automating outbound calls with AI can reduce missed appointments by 30%, cut staff workload for routine reminders by 50%, and significantly enhance client satisfaction. By ensuring timely, consistent communication and personalized reminders, this solution not only streamlines operations but also strengthens client relationships, leading to improved appointment adherence and a more efficient service delivery process.
Churn Rate Analysis: Retaining Customers
A SaaS company identifies users at risk of churning based on declining usage patterns and triggers personalized retention campaigns, reducing churn by 15%.
Problem
AI Solution
Benefits
ROI
High churn rates can severely impact revenue and growth, creating a cycle that limits expansion potential. One of the biggest challenges companies face is identifying why customers leave, often struggling to detect the signals until it’s too late. Without insight into customer sentiment or behavior, businesses risk losing loyal clients to competitors. This makes proactive measures and customer feedback essential for maintaining strong relationships, reducing churn, and securing long-term growth. Understanding the 'why' behind churn empowers your team to take data-driven actions that keep customers engaged and satisfied.
AI-driven churn analysis can accurately forecast which users are likely to leave by examining behavioral patterns, engagement metrics, and satisfaction levels. By providing these insights, AI empowers your team to implement proactive, targeted retention strategies, transforming potential losses into valuable opportunities for long-term customer loyalty.
Proactive Churn Prevention:
Identify and address customer needs early to reduce churn and maintain lasting relationships.
Enhanced Customer Retention and Loyalty:
Build strong customer connections to boost loyalty and long-term retention.
Deep, Data-Driven Insights:
Leverage in-depth analytics for informed decisions that drive growth and customer satisfaction.
Increased Revenue Stability:
Achieve consistent revenue flow by strengthening customer engagement and retention.
Competitive Advantage:
Stay ahead with strategies that differentiate your brand and meet evolving customer expectations.
Reducing churn by 5% can significantly boost long-term profitability, with 25-30% potential gains. This increase stems from the compounding effect of customer retention: loyal customers make repeat purchases, are more likely to recommend your brand, and often spend more over time. Lower churn stabilizes revenue and reduces acquisition costs, as retaining an existing customer is far more cost-effective than attracting a new one. In essence, even small improvements in churn can create a substantial, lasting impact on your bottom line.
Smart Search: Improving Discoverability
An online marketplace implements AI-powered search that suggests relevant products even when users input partial or ambiguous keywords, boosting product discoverability and conversions.
Problem
AI Solution
Benefits
ROI
Users frequently face challenges finding the right content, product, or feature, resulting in frustration and missed opportunities for deeper engagement or sales. This friction in the user journey hampers their experience and limits your brand's ability to showcase value effectively. By ensuring a smoother, more intuitive navigation and personalized recommendations, you can enhance user satisfaction, drive higher engagement, and capture additional revenue opportunities by ensuring a smoother, more intuitive navigation and personalized recommendation.
AI-based smart search intuitively understands user intent, even when queries are vague, incomplete, or ambiguous, delivering precise and highly relevant results. Analyzing patterns and learning from each user interaction continually refine and improve search accuracy, making future searches even more efficient. This dynamic, learning-based approach transforms search into a powerful tool that meets user needs instantly and adapts to evolving preferences, enhancing overall user experience and engagement.
Enhanced Search Accuracy and Relevance
Improved User Experience and Satisfaction
Increased Product Visibility and Sales
Personalized Recommendations
Reduced Search Frustration
Implementing smart search can boost search-to-purchase conversions by an impressive 35%, directly contributing to significant revenue growth. By providing users with tailored, relevant results that match their intent, smart search reduces friction in the buying process and encourages more seamless transactions. This enhancement not only accelerates the customer journey but also transforms casual browsers into committed buyers, amplifying your overall sales performance and supporting sustainable business success.
AI-Enabled Electronic Voice Verification with Delivery Confirmation: Seamless Security and Customer Assurance
A logistics company uses AI voice verification to confirm high-value deliveries. Recipients verify identity via voice scan, triggering instant delivery confirmation to both the provider and recipient's app for a secure, traceable experience.
Problem
AI Solution
Benefits
ROI
Delivery services and logistics providers frequently need help confirming successful deliveries, resulting in missed deliveries, disputes, and lowered customer satisfaction. Traditional confirmation methods, such as requiring signatures or PINs, can be inefficient and error-prone, especially in high-volume operations. These issues slow down delivery processes, increase operational costs, and negatively impact the customer experience. An optimized, technology-driven solution is essential for ensuring seamless delivery confirmation and improving overall efficiency and reliability.
An AI-powered electronic voice verification system leverages natural language processing and advanced voice recognition to securely confirm deliveries. Upon delivery, the system authenticates the recipient’s identity through voice recognition, validates delivery details, and instantly sends real-time confirmation notifications to both the client and the provider. This seamless process ensures reliable, accurate, and secure delivery tracking, eliminating disputes and enhancing operational efficiency.
Enhanced Security:
Verifies recipient identity using unique voice patterns, reducing the risk of fraud or theft.
Real-Time Confirmation:
Instantly notifies the provider and the recipient upon delivery, improving transparency and reducing disputes.
Streamlined Delivery Process:
Reduces the need for physical signatures, expedites the delivery process, and ensures accurate records.
Implementing AI-powered voice verification can reduce delivery disputes by up to 40%, significantly enhance security for high-value shipments, and boost customer satisfaction through real-time confirmation. By streamlining the verification process, this solution not only ensures more accurate and secure deliveries but also leads to improved operational efficiency, fewer failed deliveries, and a stronger overall customer experience.
AI-Powered Sales Forecasting: Precision Demand Predictions for Enhanced Revenue
A retail company uses AI forecasting to optimize inventory for seasonal sales, analyzing historical data, trends, weather, and holiday patterns. This ensures product availability during peak demand, boosting sales and reducing surplus stock.
Problem
AI Solution
Benefits
ROI
Traditional sales forecasting methods often fall short in accurately predicting demand, particularly when market trends, seasonality, and economic fluctuations are not fully accounted for. This leads to inventory mismanagement, excess stock, or stockouts, ultimately resulting in lost sales opportunities, reduced profitability, and a weakened customer experience. A more dynamic, data-driven forecasting approach is essential to align inventory with actual demand, optimize resources, and capture every growth opportunity.
AI-powered sales forecasting harnesses the power of machine learning and predictive analytics to analyze a wide range of factors, including historical data, market trends, competitor actions, and customer behavior. By uncovering hidden patterns and adapting to real-time shifts, AI delivers highly accurate sales predictions that empower businesses to stay ahead of the curve. This advanced approach enhances decision-making and enables businesses to proactively adjust strategies, optimize inventory, and seize market opportunities with greater confidence.
Increased Forecast Accuracy:
Captures complex data patterns to reduce errors in demand forecasting.
Optimized Inventory Levels:
Aligns stock with demand, reducing stockouts or excess inventory costs.
Maximized Revenue Opportunities:
By accurately forecasting demand, businesses can refine marketing, pricing, and production strategies to align with high-demand periods.
Businesses that implement AI-powered forecasting can achieve a 20-50% boost in forecast accuracy, cut stock-related costs by up to 30%, and unlock significant revenue growth by aligning supply with demand trends more effectively. This intelligent solution enables companies to optimize inventory levels, reduce excess stock and stockouts, and make data-driven decisions that drive profitability and operational efficiency.
Data Analytics & Insights: Unlocking Actionable Product Data
A SaaS company uses AI to analyze customer feedback and identify the most requested features. This helps prioritize the product roadmap based on demand rather than assumptions.

Netsmartz Builds Software Products from Scratch for Rochester-based Firm
Rochester, New York
Location
6
Team Size
Photo Advertising
Industry
The client came to Netsmartz with a concept wherein we helped them build a complete solution from scratch to enable them to go to market.
About
the Company
The client’s company is a Rochester-based firm working on integrating photo printing solutions and advertising on a single platform. The organization had a 2-prong service notion wherein they worked with end customers to provide printing solutions and worked with advertisers to market their services on the printing platform.
The Tech Stack
.Net
Swift
Kotlin
Team Composition
The engagement involved
1 backend developer
and
2 Mobile application developers
, working on iOS and Android, respectively. 1 project manager or business analyst,
1 graphics designer
, &
1 QA resource
was also allocated.
The Problem
Statement
The client came to Netsmartz with a unique concept. The client wanted to rehash the printing/photo industry – by encouraging other firms to advertise on their platform while keeping their platform free of cost for the end customers.
Using this model, the client wanted to market and sell the photo printing service at a much lower cost while enhancing overall positioning.
The client was non-technical and did not have a dedicated software team to work on the product. Since they were starting, they needed a top-to-bottom solution,i.e., from product architecture and UX to programming, QA, and mobile app development.
The
Challenge
Since the engagement was to begin from scratch, Netsmartz had to envision, map, and build the premise and product. That meant defining the user flows, UX, software architecture, and even the technology stack to utilize for the project.
Across the development engagement, Netsmartz had to educate and inform the customer on how to translate vision & expectations onto features and other technical facets.
This meant consistent collaboration, walkthroughs, daily standups, and whiteboarding/storyboarding sessions with the clients.
Netsmartz was responsible for charting, building, assessing, and explaining the product.
The
Solution
The engagement started with the business analyst, project manager, and graphic designer – were worked on storyboarding to articulate the vision and expectations of the client. This sessions were instrumentral in building the project’s premise and helping the client visualize the final product.
Netsmartz then brought in 3 developers to recognize tech stacks and implement the solution architecture.
The project manager ensured that the client was looped in on the progress to create an iterative/feedback-oriented development process.
That meant constant updations and walkthroughs to bring the client’s business/strategic insights into the product they wanted to be shaped.
Since the cost was a factor in the engagement (the client was bootstrapped with a steep time-to-market req), Netsmartz devised a low-cost hosting framework that ensured performance, scalability, and at the same time, low investment on the client’s end.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping the Project
The preliminary task was building a storyboard and architecture for the project. For this, Netsmartz allocated a PM/BA and a senior graphic designer to help encapsulate the breadth of the project in a visual, documented manner.
Collaborative Development
After the client showcased their requirements and expectations, an interviewing process was followed to hire eCommerce experts for the projects. After vetting and interviews, the PM worked with the developers on the project.
Agile Development
Since the project’s inception was from scratch, the engagement had to be agile while incorporating feedback loops, iterations, and feature additions.
Scaling the Project
After the initial phases of development, a senior QA resource was allocated to ensure bug-free functionality. This also allowed the developers to scale features and expedite the mobile application development.
The
Result
The primary achievements of this project were:
As a result, the client could enter the market and build a customer base. With the solution Netsmartz created, the client could onboard advertisers and generated a steady revenue stream while ensuring seamless functionality and an enhanced aesthetic pitch to all the stakeholders.
With the solution and the reduced go-to-market, the client could attract investors, further propelling the platform’s growth in the industry.
Enabling quicker allocation of resources also allowed the client to reduce their IT costs and extend their startup runway.

End-to-End Testing and High-Volume Load Testing for E-commerce Industry
USA
Location
8
Team Size
E-commerce
Industry
Netsmartz proficiency enabled a prominent US-based online retailer to undertake a smooth DNS migration, implement caching solutions, and perform rigorous load testing for handling 10,000 users per minute, ensuring superior user experience.
About
The Company
The client is a leading online retail powerhouse known for its extensive product range and commitment to customer satisfaction. Seeking to bolster their website’s performance and resilience, they sought our DevOps expertise for a comprehensive testing and optimization strategy.
The Tech Stack
DevOps
Magento
Team Composition
5 Developers, 3 DevOps Engineers
The Problem
Statement
The E-commerce company was facing performance issues, especially during peak traffic times. Slow page loading and unresponsive pages were affecting user experience and potentially leading to lost sales. The impending DNS migration added complexity to the situation. Migrating DNS can potentially disrupt website availability and cause downtime if not executed properly. Ensuring a seamless transition was crucial to maintaining customer trust.
The
Challenge
While undertaking this endeavor, we recognized multiple challenges like:
Enhancing website performance was paramount. Slow response times and unoptimized database queries could lead to frustrated users, abandoned carts, and decreased customer satisfaction.
Integrating caching solutions like Varnish and Redis required careful planning. If not properly configured, caching could lead to inconsistencies in displaying updated content, impacting the accuracy of product information and pricing.
The challenge of testing the website’s capability to handle a high volume of traffic was critical. Ensuring the website could withstand the demands of 10,000 users per minute without crashing or slowing down was a major undertaking.
The
Solution
Netsmartz devised an intricate solution encompassing end-to-end testing, DNS migration, and high-volume load testing to provide the company with a robust, high-performing online platform to meet its ambitious goals.
We formulated a comprehensive testing strategy encompassing functional, performance, security, and user experience testing. This approach ensured that every aspect of the website’s functionality was rigorously assessed.
Our experts meticulously planned the DNS migration process, ensuring minimal disruption to the website’s availability.
We integrated Varnish and Redis caching solutions to optimize website performance. Varnish accelerated content delivery by serving cached pages, while Redis enhanced database response times, resulting in a smoother user experience.
Rigorous load testing was conducted to evaluate the website’s performance under stress. Our team simulated traffic of 10,000 users per minute to identify bottlenecks, optimize resources, and ensure the website could handle peak traffic seamlessly.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Identifying Appropriate Resources
At Netsmartz, we conducted a detailed analysis of the project’s scope and requirements to determine the appropriate resources to be assigned to the project.
Team Engagement
The team was provided training for a week before they started working with the client. This involved understanding the client’s niche and requirements. The learning curve enabled them to generate 95% accuracy.
Consistent Client Feedback & Action
At Netsmartz, we prioritize listening to our client’s feedback and concerns. We responded promptly to client feedback, acknowledging receipt and providing action updates. This allowed us to maintain a strong client relationship and ensured that we addressed any concerns or issues they may have promptly and effectively.
The
Result
Netsmartz flawlessly executed DNS migration, ensuring uninterrupted website availability and a smooth user experience. Integration of caching solutions enhanced website performance, handling high-volume loads seamlessly. The optimized infrastructure guarantees resilience, scalability, and data-driven insights for informed decisions. These improvements have driven user satisfaction, boosted conversion rates, and positioned DEF e-commerce for future growth.

Transforming Software Development for a Multiplayer Gaming Company
US (Global)
Location
16
Team Size
Gaming Industry
Industry
Netsmartz helped a gaming company by implementing automated software deployment, configuration management, and containerization using tools like Perforce, Jenkins, and OpenVPN, improving software development efficiency.
About
The Company
The client is a leading player in the multiplayer gaming industry, providing users with an exciting and immersive gaming experience. With a rapidly growing user base and a diverse range of games.
The Tech Stack
Azure DevOps
Jenkins
Kubernetes
OpenVPN
Perforce
Ansible and Chef
Team Composition
10 Developers, 2 PMs, 2 QA, 2 DevOps
The Problem
Statement
Netsmartz was approached by a gaming company specializing in multiplayer games and faced challenges in maintaining application stability and delivering new features quickly. Due to an exponential growth in the number of users and games, the client needed a dedicated testing environment to improve their software development process. Netsmartz worked with the client to develop a solution enabling them to test new features and updates in a controlled environment, allowing for more efficient and effective software development.
The
Challenge
The client was struggling to maintain application stability and deliver new features quickly.
Manual infrastructure setup was time-consuming and led to delays in updates and maintenance, further slowing down the development process. Deployments were slow and unreliable, causing users frustration and lose of revenue for the client.
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline automation with Jenkins required significant time and resources. Automating infrastructure setup and maintenance with Ansible and Chef was also challenging due to ensuring compatibility across different systems and environments.
Containerizing applications with Docker led to faster and more reliable deployments but also required significant changes to the client’s infrastructure and development process.
Lastly, securing remote access to the infrastructure with OpenVPN required careful consideration of security and access control policies.
The
Solution
Netsmartz implemented various solutions that transformed the client’s software development process.
The team started by automating the software deployment process using Perforce for version control and Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery. This allowed for faster and more reliable updates.
Next, Ansible and Chef were used for configuration management, automating the deployment of updates and patches to the applications and services.
To containerize the applications and services, Docker and Kubernetes were used. This allowed for easy scaling and management of the infrastructure while keeping cardholder data secure. These technologies made it easier to maintain a secure and efficient system.

Offering seamless experience with AI Chatbot interactions for Fundraising Platform
Boston, Massachusetts, USA
Location
13
Team Size
Fund Raising
Industry
Netsmartz’s solution transformed higher education engagement, offering automated summaries and AI Chatbot interactions for seamless experiences. Witness innovation at its finest.
About
The Company
The client, a frontrunner in innovative solutions for academic institutions, is reshaping the landscape of alumni engagement and fundraising strategies. Their platform empowers universities and colleges to foster lasting connections with their alumni network by embracing cutting-edge technology. With an eye toward the future, our client is harnessing the potential of emerging AI technology by incorporating it into their application. At present, they harness the capabilities of OpenAI’s model while simultaneously designing the framework to seamlessly transition to other Language Models (LLMs) whenever the need arises.
The Tech Stack
Java with Dropwizard framework
GPT-3.5 Language Model
Mustache for rendering prompts
GraphQL for data querying
Team Composition
13 (2 .NET, 1 Laravel, 6 Java + ReactJS Fullstack, 2 AI Engineers, 2 QA)
The Problem
Statement
The platform showcased a manually crafted summary of user inputs, intricately gathering essential data from diverse tables and seamlessly weaving it into a coherent summary text. Nonetheless, this operation was a labor-intensive endeavor. Furthermore, an absence of an AI Chatbot capable of responding to user inquiries by intuitively generating clarifying questions represents a missed opportunity in the system’s functionality, one that could enhance user interaction and experience.
The
Challenge
There were several critical challenges our client had to overcome to achieve these objectives:
Transitioning from manual summary writing to automated AI-generated summaries might require system workflow and user expectation adjustments as users get accustomed to a different output generation process.
Training the AI Chatbot to effectively understand and respond to a wide array of user queries with relevant questions necessitates substantial initial efforts in data collection, fine-tuning, and ongoing maintenance to ensure accuracy.
Implementing a cached transaction feature for the AI Chatbot presents the challenge of developing a robust memory system that can accurately store and retrieve previous interactions while also managing potential ambiguities that might arise from maintaining context over extended conversations.
The
Solution
With Netsmartz’s pivotal involvement, their platform underwent a remarkable change, ushering in a new era of user-centric functionality and interaction.
The integration of AI technology enabled the platform to generate comprehensive summaries from user inputs automatically. This innovative approach streamlined the summary creation process and significantly reduced the manual effort previously required.
Netsmartz’s technological contributions were instrumental in enhancing user engagement and experience. We facilitated the seamless integration of an AI Chatbot feature. Users now enjoy a more dynamic and interactive experience as the AI Chatbot comprehends and responds to their inquiries naturally and engagingly.
Netsmartz’s deep involvement led to another significant enhancement in the cached transaction feature within the AI Chatbot. This innovative functionality empowers the AI to remember and recall past user interactions. As a result, conversations become more fluid and coherent, with the AI retaining context from previous exchanges.
Our
Process
Netsmartz followed the following process to fulfill the requirements of the client:
Mapping & Identifying Appropriate Resources
The preliminary task was to identify skilled resources to work on the project. Since the project was significantly high-grade – in terms of expertise and skill required, the resources were allocated dedicatedly to see the project through.
Commencing Development
After the resource allocation, the developers started working on the problem statement, defining the benchmarks, fixing bugs and errors, and crafting a better solution.
The
Result
Our experts have spearheaded the integration of groundbreaking features, such as automated AI-generated summaries, a seamlessly integrated AI Chatbot, and the innovative cached transaction capability. As a result, we enhanced their user experience and interaction, positioning their platform at the forefront of technological innovation in user engagement and data processing.

Frequently Asked Questions
Do you have additional questions?
What are the qualities of a brilliant C# developer?
C# developers should be able to code and test applications. To ensure error-free programming, their immediate attention should be on code quality. They should be able to solve complex problems while managing time and other commitments.
They must regularly keep up to date with new features, frameworks, and libraries, which necessitates quick learning. C# developers often participate in coding competitions to keep their skills sharp and fast.
How to hire C# developers with Netsmartz?
Netsmartz can assist you in finding high-quality, full-time C# software developers for staff augmentation or a dedicated team.
We’ll help you identify the best prospects from our pool of 1000+ resources who meet your needs. You can conduct a video interview with them and run a coding test to find the best candidates. We are globally available in 8 different locations throughout the world. We only collaborate with developers and agencies who have been thoroughly vetted.
Furthermore, you may hire the developers you need within a week, as identifying best-fit developers could take up to 40 hours.
What does it cost to hire a C# developer?
Experienced C# developers may charge more, but they are agile, have more specialized expertise, and produce better work.
Just like other expert developers, the rates of C# developers also depend on the business requirement- whether you need beginners, intermediate, or advanced developers for your project. Expertise and experience, location, and market conditions are all factors that influence rates.
A contractor who is still establishing a client base may offer more affordable C# developer services.
C# vs. C++: which one is better?
C# is generally preferable for simpler Windows software or back-end web development. C++ is a more sophisticated language with a steeper learning curve that provides better performance, whereas C# is easier to learn and more frequently used, making it ideal for beginners.
What are the benefits of using C# in your project?
Developed by Microsoft, C# is an object-oriented programming language. It facilitates development and maintenance by allowing app maintenance, code reuse, and creating modular.

FAQs
›
What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is an advanced AI technology that utilizes deep learning algorithms to create new content based on existing data. Unlike other AI types, such as predictive or rule-based AI, Generative AI doesn’t just analyze existing data but generates entirely new content. It employs techniques like machine learning and natural language processing to create novel outputs. For example, a Generative AI system can analyze vast image databases and produce images similar to those already in existence.
What kind of businesses can benefit from Generative AI services?
Any business that requires generating new content regularly can significantly benefit from Generative AI services. Industries such as media, entertainment, advertising, e-commerce, and education can leverage Generative AI to consistently produce diverse and engaging content, optimizing their processes and enhancing user experiences.
How can I get started with a Generative AI development project?
To begin a Generative AI development project, simply reach out to
Netsmartz
, a leading provider of Generative AI development services. Our team of experts will engage in a detailed discussion with you to understand your project requirements and objectives. Based on this analysis, we will provide you with a comprehensive project proposal, including an estimate of the project cost, timeline, and required resources.
How does Generative AI work?
Generative AI operates through the use of neural networks and deep learning algorithms. It learns from a vast amount of data during a training phase, capturing intricate patterns and structures. Once trained, the Generative AI model can generate new content by extrapolating from the patterns it has learned. For instance, a Generative text model can produce coherent paragraphs resembling human-written text, and a Generative image model can generate realistic pictures based on the input it has received.
What are some practical applications of Generative AI?
Generative AI has found applications across a diverse range of fields. In the world of art and design, it can create unique pieces of artwork and innovative designs. In marketing, it aids in generating personalized content and advertisements. In entertainment, Generative AI can compose music and scripts. Additionally, it has applications in data augmentation for machine learning, virtual reality simulation, and even scientific simulations.
Can Generative AI be integrated into SaaS platforms?
Yes, Generative AI can be seamlessly integrated into
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platforms
to enhance various aspects of the user experience. It can be used to automate content creation, assist in data analysis, provide personalized recommendations, and even simulate scenarios. By incorporating Generative AI, SaaS platforms can offer users more intelligent and interactive features, contributing to higher user engagement and satisfaction.
Are there any challenges associated with Generative AI in SaaS?
While Generative AI holds great potential, there are challenges that need to be addressed. One major concern is the quality and relevance of the generated content. Ensuring that the AI-produced outputs align with the brand’s voice and style requires careful tuning and monitoring. Additionally, potential biases present in the training data can lead to undesirable or inappropriate content generation, requiring continuous evaluation and refinement of the AI model.
What considerations are important when implementing Generative AI in SaaS?
When implementing Generative AI in SaaS, several considerations come into play. Data privacy and user consent are crucial, as user data may be used to train the AI model. The ethical use of AI-generated content is essential to ensure that the generated outputs meet ethical standards and do not mislead or harm users. It’s also important to fine-tune the AI model to align with the brand’s identity and consistently deliver valuable and relevant content.

The Tech Stack
Java
Angular
H2DB
Jhipster
Hibernate
Kafka
Microservices
Team Composition
The team consists of Business Analysts, Solution Architects, Quality Analysts, Designers, UI Developers, Full Stack Developers and Java Developers.
The Problem
Statement
The significant issues clients faced were third-party integrations that required profound research and the necessity to establish a robust security system.
This also requires the system to grant permissions and access at various levels. Proper team management was also needed to understand the cause of delayed response time and better utilization.
The
Challenge
The client’s main challenge was third-party integrations that needed deep research and constant follow-up with multiple platforms. These platforms were:
JHipster
– JHipster is a development platform to quickly generate, develop, and deploy modern web applications and microservice architectures.
Angular
– Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your applications.
The
Solution
Leveraging a team of skilled professionals and a well-planned approach, Netsmartz successfully addressed various obstacles and provided a comprehensive suite of  solutions.
Netsmartz utilized a team of skilled professionals and a range of open-source tools for test automation (Selenium, Appium, Selenoid, Selendroid, Rest Assured, Karate DSL, Playwright, Robot Framework, Citrus, Cypress, TestCafe), performance testing (JMeter, Locust), security scanning (ZAP Proxy, Jaeger, Zipkin), identity management (Keycloak, Casbin), API gateway management (Kong Gateway, Apache Apisix, Krakend), data integration (Airbyte, Apache NiFi), service virtualization (Hoverfly, Mountebank), and test data management (Database Subset, Condenser, Jailer, SymmetricDS, Rdbms-subsetter, Fogger, Synthetic Data Vault, Java Faker).
Our
Process
Netsmartz helped the client by segmenting the software development into different steps:
Brainstorming and Team Requirement Mapping
1.Proper Brainstorming and requirement mapping was done with the client’s team as per the features. After planning, a proper roadmap was designed for the project.
Skill Identification & Team Integrations
Team worked on documenting the user stories and UI preparation with the client. Proper skill identification was made, and a team well-versed in Node, Android, and iOS development was deployed for seamless 3rd party integrations.
Project Planning & Launch Plan
Project planning and launch plan was built with different phases, providing chore management and a rewarding system with a third-party platform while manually maintaining the transaction records within the app. This helps customer acquisition and further integration with Galileo and Moodle, dealing with actual money through platforms and physical cards with paid subscriptions.
Team Deployment & Sprint Planning
Team deployment to work on the application. The team consisted of developers, QA, and project managers to deliver the best application development. Sprint planning and execution were monitored through JIRA.
The
Result
Netsmartz’s association with the client resulted in the following.
The client has a better view of product development and phase development.
The transparent vision of the current and future product development helped the client plan a better marketing strategy.
Better finance management for the client and seamless third-party integrations.

Frequently Asked Questions
Do you have additional questions?
Why is Ruby on Rails so popular?
Back in 2006, the Ruby on Rails framework was a key component in Ruby, known as “the best programming language.” Because of its ability to ease repetitive operations and enhance optimization processes, RoR has drastically transformed the use of the Ruby language.
Many Fortune 500 organizations use RoR to build their web apps and services. To make deployment in web applications more accessible, big tech organizations are hiring RoR developers for their software development projects.
What are the responsibilities of a Ruby on Rails developer?
Our skilled RoR developers design and develop new web applications from scratch. They even maintain and troubleshoot the already existing software applications. Moreover, they assist in the creation and maintenance of reliable Ruby code and the integration of data storage solutions into the software.
How much does Ruby on Rails cost?
The average rate for a Ruby on Rails developer is determined by their level of experience, expertise, and location availability. The cost of developing a web application with Ruby on Rails is significantly less than with other frameworks.
We, at Netsmartz, consider the difference in hourly or full-time pricing for different engagement types, such as temporary, part-time, and freelancing, when hiring Ruby on Rails developers.
Why is Ruby on Rails a perfect choice for businesses?
Ruby on Rails is a combination of libraries, easy-to-use code, and a well-managed framework. It is low-cost and provides both front-end & backend solutions. It’s quick and integrates well with agile project management without wasting time on iterations. It also uses MVC or DRY, saving time and enhancing developer productivity.
Why do most of the startups pick RoR development?
The main reason why startups choose Ruby on Rails is that it is time-efficient. Yes, it’s the framework that comes with many pre-built plugins and modules that allow developers to jump right into developing a web project without having to write boilerplate code. RoR using teams is 30-40% faster than teams using other programming languages and frameworks in building applications.

Upgrading Solution with New Features for a SaaS Company
Client based out of USA. Dev team based out of India
Location

Team Size
Security
Industry
The solution was built as a two-part, multi-use system designed and created from the voice of public safety. The paired system includes software and a 360-degree spherical image capture kit and is used for documenting scenes like municipal code violations & homicide scene investigations.
About
The Company
Specializing in data collection, workflow processes and offering hardware and software solutions, the company works with their clients to define, develop and deliver the best SAAS based solution to fit each client’s unique needs. The customer works in a way to ensure successful implementation of each solution by selecting only the best of breed manufacturers and offering robust customer support.
The Tech Stack
NodeJS
ExpressJS
MySQL
VueJS
Electron
Cordova
Playwright
Team Composition
The team consists of Business Analysts, Solution Architects, Quality Analysts, Full stack Developer, Project Manager and designer.
The Problem
Statement
The most significant issues that the customer was facing were related to –
The framework and libraries version being used in applications. Adding new features to scale up an existing solution was a bit difficult for the client and they reached out to Netsmartz to get this covered.
Managing the security protocols within the solution. Considering the solution was a security-based one, privacy was important which was lacking in the initial code.
Scaling up the old code. We had to refactor the entire code to make it scalable.
No testing framework or process was set up initially.
The
Challenge
he main challenge with the desktop application was that the frameworks and libraries were very outdated and had a lot of security lapses cause of which we had to rebuild the structure from the scratch.
Code structure was not set up correctly and again had to be done from the scratch.
The
Solution
Netsmartz helping by set up a team of professionals, developers working through all the tech stacks and all the integration prerequisites.
A team of seasoned professionals at Netsmartz ensured a firm grip on the system and well planned and phased approach, which led to a smooth and efficient implementation of every module in a time-boxed sprint.
Our
Process
Netsmartz helping the client by segmenting the software development into different steps:
Brainstorming and team requirement mapping
Proper Brainstorming and requirement mapping was done with the client’s team as per the features. After planning, a proper roadmap was designed for the project.
Skill identification & team integrations
Team worked on documenting the user stories and UI preparation with the client. Proper skill identification was made, and a team well-versed in Node, Vue, Electron, and Cordova was deployed.
Project planning & launch plan
Project planning and launch plan were setup with a phased approach. Discussions were done with the client to bring them up to speed with the plan for upgrading all the frameworks and libraries and for restructuring the entire code based on correct standards.
Team Deployment & Sprint planning
Team was deployed to work on the application. The team consisted of Business Analysts, Solution Architects, Quality Analysts, Full stack Developer, Project Manager and designer to deliver the best application development. Sprint planning and execution were monitored through JIRA.
The
Result
Netsmartz’s association with the client resulted in the following;
The client had a better view of the product development and phase development.
Better code quality and structure were setup to make the legacy code usable for any scaling up that needs to be done to the solution.
The transparent vision of the current and future product development helped the client plan a better marketing strategy.
