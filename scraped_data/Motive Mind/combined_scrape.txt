Driving the experience enterprise agenda
Set up a Discovery Call
Experience
Enterprise
If there’s anything that’s driving the Industry 4.0 agenda, that is Experience. The bots, conversational AI, analytics, digital core, cloud and mobile, everything is converging to consistently deliver the experience of life time to their customers and employees.
While few enterprises are ahead of the game, few others are catching up. Customer expectations, market changes and demands on operational efficiencies have pushed businesses to rapidly adopt the digital technologies to be relevant in the marketplace. Digital age ecosystems, such as SAP and Salesforce, with their ecosystems, are further pushing the business to be an Experience Enterprise that is hyper agile, insight-driven, efficient and delivers incredible customer experience.
Motiveminds is at the center of this transformation. There is no cookie cutter solution to realize the experience enterprise dream. We take a consulting and business goal driven approach in helping you realize the dream. This approach ensured us to improve the engagement completion rates within budgets and time.
We’ve designed our organization on Experience and our singular focus is
“Experience”

transforming enterprises

Vishal Vincent, President & CEO, Arat Builders
“Working with Motiveminds is a breeze. The team understands our goals and their expertise in SAP S/4HANA and associated products is second to none. With Motiveminds in the driver seat, my team sleeps well”
Nagabushana Reddy, VP - Business Strategy, iValue InfoSolutions
The choice to go with SAP S/4HANA private cloud was easy, however, to find the right partner for the implementation was not an easy task. After spending a considerable amount time in the pursuit to find the right partner, we were delighted to be connected with Motiveminds Consulting Pvt Ltd. We needed an SAP partner who not only understood the complexity of the solution but could also work collaboratively with our team and the moment we engaged with Motiveminds, we knew we were in the right hands.
One of our concerns was that our business model’s integration of CRM and data migration might be very complex for a partner to understand.  However, the Motiveminds team assessed our unique challenges with an in-depth analysis and tailored a solution that aligned with our business goals. They integrated our business processes with S4/HANA within six months and that would not have been possible without the professionalism, industry knowledge and the expertise that the team holds. Each team member was always available to address any concerns that we had.
Thanks to Motiveminds we have transformed our business processes and we are confident of witnessing huge improvement in our business functionality and we can see some positive changes already. We are grateful to have worked with a team that got on the ground, took ownership and was collaborative. We look forward to continuing our relationship with Motiveminds and highly recommend Motiveminds to any organisation seeking a reliable and customer-centric implementation partner.

Transform from human resource management to employee experience management

High employee experience means
happy people, highly engaging and innovative solutions.
HR is one function that touches each and every employee in an organization and is responsible for their engagement and experience. The employee experience primarily defines their engagement, productivity and ability to create innovative solutions for the clients. However, HR has a wider gamut of core functions to manage beyond engaging people – Payroll, Recruitment, Talent Management and Wellbeing. Effectively managing all these functions need a digital solution that helps you deliver a great working environment for your employees, respond better to the market changes, and take data-driven real-time decisions. The severity and range of challenges for HR include, lack of

to reduce unnecessary duplication while managing the employee master data, dated
HR process, seams in
HR systems that are not integrated with the rest of the organization, localized legal requirements and many more.
